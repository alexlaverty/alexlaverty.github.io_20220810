The bank robber came many years later when Len was assistant man ager at the Commonwealth Bank branch in Maclean.</p><p>Raised at Taylors Arm, near Macksville, Len was 15 when he finished school in 1960 and a few weeks later started work with the Commonwealth Bank.</p><p>“There were no vacancies in the bank at Macksville, so they sent me to Sydney to the bank’s head office in Martin Place,” Len recalls.</p><p>“There were probably around 500 people working at head office and I was right down in the dungeons with the old records. By law in those days banks had to keep cheques and records for seven years and we would spend each day filing the new ones and discarding those that were no longer needed….pret ty boring work down in the basement.”</p><p>There were ups and downs, up to the first floor to where mail was processed and cheques dispatched to other banks and branches on ex changes, then down to the bills and overseas</p><p>section where much of the work involved foreign ex change transactions and tra veller’s cheques.</p><p>“This was in the early 60s when anyone travelling over seas had to take travellers’ cheques and currency for the country they were going to,” says Len. “There was an ex change at Sydney airport, - a little section no bigger than your average kitchen-and the banks used to staff it on a month-about basis.</p><p>“Somebody had to be there for every plane that came in or went out. Sometimes the day would start at 5 am and the last plane would not come in until 11 pm.</p><p>“I was only 19 and it was pretty exciting to meet people like Alan Davidson, who ac tually worked for the bank. I had a bit to do with him and met others like Don Lane and Jack Brabham passing through the airport” But Len was keen to leave the big smoke trans and applied and was accepted. for work with the bank in Papua New Guinea.</p><p>He was appointed to the branch being established at Kieta on Bougainville Island when the copper mine was opening, one of many overseas workers servicing the project. With “seven or eight” other single male bank employees he lived in what had been a plantation manager’s cottage on the coconut plantation that turned into a mine site.</p><p>“I was there 12 months, - more than enough,” he recalls. “There was nothing to do in non-working hours except drink or go swim ming.”</p><p>The second half of his overseas posting was spent at the bank’s Port Moresby branch “a much more sociable situation”.</p><p>Travel around PNG was virtually all by air, small plane or helicopter, in relatively unsophisticated aircraft and primitive flying conditions. One flight from Rabaul to Kieta seemed likely to end in disaster when thick cloud closed in and without radar or lights, the pilot was unable to find his landing strip. “We circled around for half an hour or more until through a tiny break in the clouds he spotted the airfield. Were we re lieved,” says Len.</p><p>Back in Australia, Len worked on relieving staff around Sydney branches, re-acquainting himself with general branch activities and routine.</p><p>“No computers of course, all the balances, monthly interest payments etc calculated with an adding machine and an accounting machine.</p><p>“June was the big mon th… interest would have to go into the savings accounts and we would try to get that all finished by the middle of the month. Now you just have to press a button and that in formation is all there on com puter.”</p><p>Computers were the coming thing in banking when Len was appointed to relieving staff at Wagga Wagga in the early 1970s. The city had two Commonwealth Bank branch es, total staff around 45, and the main branch was an agen cy for the Reserve Bank, col lecting old bank notes to be cancelled and distributing anything up to $100,000 a week in new currency to other banks.</p><p>Even with such large amounts of cash on hand, in those more relaxed times security was not a major con cern.</p><p>“We didn’t actually have any ‘security” Len recalls. “It all took place in a locked room and the officers were issued with pistols. The skill we had with them, they were probably more a danger than a help. “In the end I</p><p>refused to carry one at all.” Len was to stay in Wagga Wagga for 12 years, rising to the rank of assistant manag er before he and wife Wendy decided to bring their three daughters to Maclean where he was appoint ed assistant manager.</p><p>Today Len and Wendy’s daughters, Carol, Terese (Mrs Rick Woollett) and Lenice, all live in Klama, home too, for two young grandchildren.</p><p>In truth Len missed most of the action in the March 10, 1988 hold-up of the Maclean branch.</p><p>“It was lunch time and I had walked out the back of the bank when the robber came In Just one man, they said he was armed.</p><p>The next day’s Daily Exa miner reported the robbery and a police claim that the robber was carrying a saw-off shotgun concealed inside a shopping bag.</p><p>“When I came back into the bank the feller was shaking and he said I’ve been robbed,” says Len.</p><p>“As far as the thief was concerned it was a case of wrong time, wrong teller. There were two tellers on duty, one on general transac tions and the other, the one he demanded money from, count ing cash from a kid’s piggy bank. The bandit would have got very little for his trou ble…. the other teller would have had much more.”</p><p>Witnesses gave police a description of the getaway car and thief was quickly traced to Ballina and arrested. “Banking certainly changed</p><p>during my career,” says Len. “In the early days after work we would go to the club or pub for a few drinks… and do a lot of business while you were there. There was more gentlemanly co-operation between the banks in those days, too.</p><p>“When ATMs came to Ma clean in the early 1980s bank staff had to educate ourselves and the public to use them. There were funny stories.</p><p>“One fellow came in quite upset because the ATM would not give him a pay-out. Every thing he was doing seemed right but it turned out there was no cash in his account.</p><p>“Another woman came in complaining that money was disappearing out of her ac count. When we checked, the withdrawals were all being made late at night and it was finally established that a fami ly member was taking her credit card and using it, while she slept.”</p><p>Len Laverty retired from the bank in Maclean in 1996. “They wanted to move me somewhere else but I had three young children and I wanted to stay in Maclean,” he</p><p>In his retirement, he is involved with church work, notably for St Vincent de Paul in Maclean, and through a former Lions Club mate Terry Cording, with development of the Lawrence Museum, partic ularly its communications exhibits.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/laverty-family-history/'>Laverty Family History</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/len-laverty/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Len Laverty</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Len Laverty - Telling Career - Alex Laverty&url=https://alexlaverty.github.io/Telling-Career-Len-Laverty/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Len Laverty - Telling Career - Alex Laverty&u=https://alexlaverty.github.io/Telling-Career-Len-Laverty/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Facebook"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Len Laverty - Telling Career - Alex Laverty&url=https://alexlaverty.github.io/Telling-Career-Len-Laverty/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Telegram"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recent Update</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/Colour-Correct-Underwater-Footage-With-DaVinci-Resolve/">Colour Correcting Underwater Footage With DaVinci Resolve</a><li><a href="/the-cooks-of-stuarts-point/">The Cooks of Stuarts Point</a><li><a href="/mountains-of-mourne/">Mountains of Mourne</a><li><a href="/Descendants-of-Charles-Dornan/">Descendants of Charles Dornan</a><li><a href="/denis-michael-laverty-obituary/">Denis Michael Laverty Obituary</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/reunion/">reunion</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/denis-laverty/">Denis Laverty</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/johann-peter-koch/">Johann Peter Koch</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/john-mcgree/">John McGree</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/patrick-mcgree/">Patrick McGree</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/laverty/">laverty</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/michael-laverty/">Michael Laverty</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/nora-goldspring/">Nora Goldspring</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/python/">python</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/elsie-pearl-mcgree/">Elsie Pearl McGree</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/planning-begins-for-mcgree-photo-presentation/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="timeago small" date="1999-09-29 00:00:00 +1000" >Sep 29, 1999</em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Planning Begins for McGree Photo Presentation</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Planning begins for McGree photo presentation The mysterious saga of a photograph taken during World War One has almost reached its heart-warming finale.
