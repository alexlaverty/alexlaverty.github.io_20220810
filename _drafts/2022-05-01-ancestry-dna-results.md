I purchased an AncestryDNA test recently, you have to spit in a tube and then mail it off for DNA analysis, it must be sent via international snail mail because 
it takes a long time for it to arrive at it's destination which I think was in Ireland, I took a bout 2 months for my parcel to arrive for processing.

Fortunately it has a progress bar on the website which tells you a what part of the process you're up to, I think it took a further couple weeks for the DNA analysis to be completed and available to browse.
