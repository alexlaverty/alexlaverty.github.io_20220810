The lyrics to the song The Mountains of Mourne (originally spelt The Mountains o' Mourne) were written by Irish musician Percy French (1854–1920), the music was composed by Houston Collisson (1865–1920). Another theory is that it is based on the traditional Irish folk tune "Carrigdonn" or "Carrigdhoun".[1] The latter was the same tune used by Thomas Moore (1779–1852) for his song Bendemeer's Stream.

The song is representative of French's many works concerning the Irish diaspora. The Mourne Mountains of the title are located in **County Down in Northern Ireland**.

The song is a whimsical look at the styles, attitudes and fashions of late nineteenth-century London as seen from the point of view of an emigrant labourer from a village near the Mourne Mountains. It is written as a message to the narrator's true love at home. The "sweep down to the sea" refrain was inspired by the view of the mountains from Skerries in north County Dublin. It contrasts the artificial attractions of the city with the more natural beauty of his homeland.



## Lyrics

Oh Mary this London's a wonderful sight
There's people here working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes nor barley nor wheat
There's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street
At least when I asked them that's what I was told
So I took me a hand at this digging for gold
But for all that I've found there I might as well be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea
You remember old Peter O'Loughlin of course
He's here now at the head of the force
I saw him today (while I) was crossing the strand
He stopped the whole line with a wave of his hand
And as we stood talking the days that are gone
The whole population of London looked on
But for all his fine powers he's wishful like me
To be where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea
There's beautiful girls here oh, never you mind
With beautiful shapes nature never designed
With lovely complexions all roses and cream
And O'Loughlin remarks with regards to the same
Of all these fine flowers you venture to sip
The color might all come away on your lip
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waiting for me
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea
Oh Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
