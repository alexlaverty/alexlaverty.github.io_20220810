For some reason I was awake this morning and I noticed a golden glow coming through the window so I grabbed my camera and raced to the roof to take some photos.
There was also a double rainbow over the Manly Cricket Oval and I also received a phone call later that morning to find out my nephew had been born, what a day!
So I dedicate these photos to my nephew Gabriel.
