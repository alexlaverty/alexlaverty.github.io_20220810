We're on day 3 of sitting around the apartment due to coronavirus lockdown, we've got enough food to last a week or two but most of it is canned and dried food, so not a lot of fresh vegetables at the moment.

I remembered I still have my microgreen trays and some seeds left over.

I got my solar panels,battery box and LED lights out of the van that we use when we go camping and am going to
setup a solar powered LED lighting system in the apartment to help speed up the growth of the microgreens.

Step one is to soak the sunflower seeds in water overnight, this kick starts the germination process.

once the seeds have soaked overnight, put some organic potting mix in a tray and water the soil, spread the sunflower seeds on top of the soil.

Next cover the seeds for 3 to 5 days, this encourages the plant to focus on growing the roots down into the soil.

Make sure the soil stays moist, water every couple of days.

Uncover the seeds and allow another 5 days to grow to a height of about 5 inches.

Once you're ready to harvest snip the microgreens with some sharp scissors.

Rinse well with water and then they're ready to eat.

I order seeds in bulk off the website [https://www.australianwheatgrass.com.au/](https://www.australianwheatgrass.com.au/) they are based out at Riverstone, it's a lot more cost effective then buying small packets of seeds at bunnings.

You can also get the seedling trays from the above website or Bunnings also has them for around the same price.
