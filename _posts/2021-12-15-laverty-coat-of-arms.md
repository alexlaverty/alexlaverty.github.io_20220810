## Laverty Coat of Arms - Fortune Favours The Brave


The official heraldic description of the Laverty Coat of Arms is as follows:

Argent, 2 lions rampant combatant supporting a dexter hand couped at the wrist all gules,
in base a boat with 8 oars sable.

This is a heraldic shorthand description of what is on the shield, and translated into today's common language, it means that the base color of the shield is argent - or silver-white. This color denotes nobility, serenity and peace. It also is associated with the quality of purity, because it withstands the test of fire.

The next part of the description is what is on the upper half of the shield. The Laverty shield contains the representation of two lions facing each other in a rampant, combatant pose. The lion, as the king of beasts, signified majesty and kingship from early Roman times. In later use, the lions have become emblematic of strength, courage, and generosity.


The lions are holding a human right (dexter) hand that is cut off (couped) at the wrist. The color of the lions and the dexter hand are all red, or gules as used in heraldry. The red represents fortitude and creative power.


Another interpretation of the red hand cut off at the wrist is associated with the legend of the "bloody hand of O'Neill". Several ships were racing toward land, and it had been agreed that the person who first laid his right hand on the shore would lay claim to the land. When O'Neill saw that he was behind in the race, he grabbed a sword, cut off his right hand, and heaved it onto shore ahead of the others to claim the land. Thus, the "bloody" red dexter hand has become a common Irish heraldic symbol of ingenuity.


The final part of the description refers to what is in the base, or bottom half, of the shield. The Laverty shield has a boat with 8 oars. From earliest times, the symbol of a boat represented security, stemming from the biblical story of Noah's Ark. In more modern times, the boat is indicative of venture and travel. The "sable" refers to the black color of the boat, which is associated with night and repentance. The sable color is also attributed to the quality of serenity.
