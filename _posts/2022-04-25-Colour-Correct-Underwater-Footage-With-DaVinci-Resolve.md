## Colour Grading Underwater Footage With DaVinci Resolve

A while ago I went camping with my family to Narrabeen Caravan Park, while there I took some underwater video of various sea creatures with my Sony Action camera.

The original video I captured didn't look that great, but I was able to fix it up using video editing software called DaVinci Resolve.

This video will demonstrate how I colour corrected the underwater footage with a couple of example clips :
