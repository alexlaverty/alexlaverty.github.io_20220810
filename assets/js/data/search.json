    "snippet": "  Introduction  Choosing a Programming Language  Scraping Forecast Data with BeautifulSoup  Parsing the JSON Data  Adding Data to Pandas Data Frame  Figuring out Weird Wave and Wind Data Structure  Export Dataframe as a HTML Table with CSS Styling  Generate Deployment on a Daily Schedule Using Github Action WorkflowIntroductionI like to go to the beach and often find myself checking the Sydney surf forecast at Seabreeze.com.auhttps://www.seabreeze.com.au/weather/wind-forecast/sydneyIt can take a little while to look at each day and use my mouse to hover over the chart to see wind speed and wave height etc and check the second chart for swell period and direction.I wanted to see if I could write a script that would scrape this data for me, put it into a table, apply my personal surf condition preferences to the table and also filter out days where the surf was bad and make it accessible on this website, the end result is this report :https://alexlaverty.github.io/surf/index.htmlGreen is good, red is bad, the more green cells on a row, the better the conditions will be.Choosing a Programming LanguageThis script could be written using various programming languages, I am currently learning Python so I have chosen it to write the script, Python also has the Pandas library at our disposal which is pretty powerful.Scraping Forecast Data with BeautifulSoupTo get started we will scrape the surf forecast data using the python library BeautifulSoup.This snippet of code will connect to the Seabreeze forecast for Sydney and retrieve the websites HTML code :from bs4 import BeautifulSoupimport requests url = &quot;https://www.seabreeze.com.au/weather/wind-forecast/sydney&quot;page = requests.get(url)         soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, &quot;html.parser&quot;)print(soup)Copy and paste this view-source link into your chrome browser to see what that html code looks like :view-source:https://www.seabreeze.com.au/weather/wind-forecast/sydneyParsing the JSON DataScrolling through the HTML I can see a bunch of interesting data embedded in JSON value in var json={} :Using regex I grab script instances that match the text with the following expression var json={.*};I was having trouble parsing this text as JSON so had to do some string replacing to get it working,I’m sure there’s a better regex expression that could exactly match what I needed, but that can be a future improvement.# Needs a better regex expressionpattern = re.compile(r&#39;var json={.*};&#39;, re.DOTALL)script = soup.find(&#39;script&#39;, text=pattern)data = pattern.search(script.text).group(0)# tidies beginning and end of json string so json.loads works correctlydata = data.replace(&quot;var json=&quot;, &quot;&quot;)data = data.replace(&quot;};&quot;, &quot;}&quot;)self.json = json.loads(data)Once we’ve extracted the JSON properly we have something like this to extract values from :print(json){&#39;global&#39;: {&#39;issueUtc&#39;: &#39;2021-10-10T07:00:58.852Z&#39;, &#39;isCustomLayout&#39;: False, &#39;renderMode&#39;: 1, &#39;arrows&#39;:

We will reference this secret in the build yml.Create Github Action Workflow YML ConfigGithub Actions allows you to define build steps by creating yml build definitions in the root of the repository at .github/workflowsHere is my github workflow yml for generating the gramps website, i have added comments to the file belowhttps://github.com/alexlaverty/alexlaverty.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/genealogy.yml# Give the Github Action Workflow a Name name: Genealogy# Trigger the build when a file is checked into the folder paths genealogy or the github workflow is updated # when the checkin is to the main branchon:  push:    paths:      - &#39;genealogy/**&#39;      - &#39;.github/workflows/genealogy.yml&#39;    branches:      - mainjobs:  build:    # Run on a ubuntu build agent    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    # Run in a docker container with the required build dependencies installed     container: alexlaverty/alexlaverty:1.0.2    # Run commands from within the genealogy website    env:      working-directory: ./genealogy    steps:      # Checkout the github repo      - name: checkout repo content        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # checkout the repository content to github runner               # Decrypt the 7Zip gedcom file,       # do a small workaround for a bug,       # generate the Gramps website and then clean up the decrypted gedcom file      - name: Generate Gramps Narrated Website        run: |          7z x gramps.7z -p$GRAMPS_ZIP_PASSWORD -y          # Workaround for bug in database name in Gramps generic.py          sed -i &#39;s/name.txt/database.txt/g&#39; /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gramps/gen/db/generic.py          gramps -i gramps.ged -a report -p name=navwebpage,incl_private=False,living_people=2,target=./          rm -f gramps.ged        working-directory: $        # The ZIP file password is stored as a github repo secret        env:          GRAMPS_ZIP_PASSWORD: $      # Commit the generated files and push them up to the github repo      - name: commit files        run: |          git config --local user.email &quot;action@github.com&quot;          git config --local user.name &quot;GitHub Action&quot;          git add -A          git commit -m &quot;Genealogy Update&quot; -a        working-directory: $                - name: push changes        uses: ad-m/github-push-action@v0.6.0        with:          github_token: $          branch: mainDocker Image with Gramps Depenencies InstalledThe alexlaverty/alexlaverty:1.0.2 docker image that I am referecing in the build has gramps, 7zip and git installed in it, the dockerfile is :https://github.com/alexlaverty/alexlaverty.github.io/blob/main/DockerfileFROM ubuntuENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractiveRUN apt-get update -y &amp;amp;&amp;amp; \\    apt-get install -y \\            python3-pip \\            p7zip-full \\            gramps \\            gitI plan on using that container for some other builds so will probably add in extra dependecies in there for my other projects later.Viewing the Github Actions Workflow Build StatusOnce you’ve pushed your encrypted gedcom zip into your github pages repo and have pushed your Github Actions Workflow YML config you should then be able to go see your build run and view the status and build log for it.In your github pages repo, click Actions --&amp;gt; Genealogy Then click on a buildFrom here you can see the status of each step and click each step and see the build log outputBrowsing Your Generated Gramps WebsiteOnce you build is successful you should be able to view your Gramps Github Pages website, for example mine is :https://alexlaverty.github.io/genealogy/Other Options When Generating Gramps WebsiteTo view other available parameters you can use while generating the Gramps Narrated Website run the following commands :gramps -i gramps.ged -a report -p name=navwebpage,show=allPerforming action: report.Using options string: name=navwebpage,show=all   Available options:      ancestortree      Whether to include an ancestor graph on each individual page ()      archive           Whether to store the web pages in an archive file ()      birthorder        Whether to display children in birth order or in entry order?

    "snippet": "‘Which’ bank provided Len Laverty with such a diverse working life?Commonwealth Bank officer Len Laverty had his job to thank for meeting 60s celebrities like cricketer Alan Davidson, entertainer Don Lane and racing driver Jack Brabham… plus a near encounter with an armed robber.The celebrities came Len’s way when, as a junior bank employee, he helped staff the travellers’ exchange facility at Sydney airport. The bank robber came many years later when Len was assistant man ager at the Commonwealth Bank branch in Maclean.Raised at Taylors Arm, near Macksville, Len was 15 when he finished school in 1960 and a few weeks later started work with the Commonwealth Bank.“There were no vacancies in the bank at Macksville, so they sent me to Sydney to the bank’s head office in Martin Place,” Len recalls.“There were probably around 500 people working at head office and I was right down in the dungeons with the old records. By law in those days banks had to keep cheques and records for seven years and we would spend each day filing the new ones and discarding those that were no longer needed….pret ty boring work down in the basement.”There were ups and downs, up to the first floor to where mail was processed and cheques dispatched to other banks and branches on ex changes, then down to the bills and overseassection where much of the work involved foreign ex change transactions and tra veller’s cheques.“This was in the early 60s when anyone travelling over seas had to take travellers’ cheques and currency for the country they were going to,” says Len. “There was an ex change at Sydney airport, - a little section no bigger than your average kitchen-and the banks used to staff it on a month-about basis.“Somebody had to be there for every plane that came in or went out. Sometimes the day would start at 5 am and the last plane would not come in until 11 pm.“I was only 19 and it was pretty exciting to meet people like Alan Davidson, who ac tually worked for the bank. I had a bit to do with him and met others like Don Lane and Jack Brabham passing through the airport” But Len was keen to leave the big smoke trans and applied and was accepted. for work with the bank in Papua New Guinea.He was appointed to the branch being established at Kieta on Bougainville Island when the copper mine was opening, one of many overseas workers servicing the project. With “seven or eight” other single male bank employees he lived in what had been a plantation manager’s cottage on the coconut plantation that turned into a mine site.“I was there 12 months, - more than enough,” he recalls. “There was nothing to do in non-working hours except drink or go swim ming.”The second half of his overseas posting was spent at the bank’s Port Moresby branch “a much more sociable situation”.Travel around PNG was virtually all by air, small plane or helicopter, in relatively unsophisticated aircraft and primitive flying conditions. One flight from Rabaul to Kieta seemed likely to end in disaster when thick cloud closed in and without radar or lights, the pilot was unable to find his landing strip. “We circled around for half an hour or more until through a tiny break in the clouds he spotted the airfield. Were we re lieved,” says Len.Back in Australia, Len worked on relieving staff around Sydney branches, re-acquainting himself with general branch activities and routine.“No computers of course, all the balances, monthly interest payments etc calculated with an adding machine and an accounting machine.“June was the big mon th… interest would have to go into the savings accounts and we would try to get that all finished by the middle of the month. Now you just have to press a button and that in formation is all there on com puter.”Computers were the coming thing in banking when Len was appointed to relieving staff at Wagga Wagga in the early 1970s. The city had two Commonwealth Bank branch es, total staff around 45, and the main branch was an agen cy for the Reserve Bank, col lecting old bank notes to be cancelled and distributing anything up to $100,000 a week in new currency to other banks.Even with such large amounts of cash on hand, in those more relaxed times security was not a major con cern.“We didn’t actually have any ‘security” Len recalls. “It all took place in a locked room and the officers were issued with pistols. The skill we had with them, they were probably more a danger than a help. “In the end Irefused to carry one at all.” Len was to stay in Wagga Wagga for 12 years, rising to the rank of assistant manag er before he and wife Wendy decided to bring their three daughters to Maclean where he was appoint ed assistant manager.Today Len and Wendy’s daughters, Carol, Terese (Mrs Rick Woollett) and Lenice, all live in Klama, home too, for two young grandchildren.In truth Len missed most of the action in the March 10, 1988 hold-up of the Maclean branch.“It was lunch time and I had walked out the back of the bank when the robber came In Just one man, they said he was armed.The next day’s Daily Exa miner reported the robbery and a police claim that the robber was carrying a saw-off shotgun concealed inside a shopping bag.“When I came back into the bank the feller was shaking and he said I’ve been robbed,” says Len.“As far as the thief was concerned it was a case of wrong time, wrong teller. There were two tellers on duty, one on general transac tions and the other, the one he demanded money from, count ing cash from a kid’s piggy bank. The bandit would have got very little for his trou ble…. the other teller would have had much more.”Witnesses gave police a description of the getaway car and thief was quickly traced to Ballina and arrested. “Banking certainly changedduring my career,” says Len. “In the early days after work we would go to the club or pub for a few drinks… and do a lot of business while you were there. There was more gentlemanly co-operation between the banks in those days, too.“When ATMs came to Ma clean in the early 1980s bank staff had to educate ourselves and the public to use them. There were funny stories.“One fellow came in quite upset because the ATM would not give him a pay-out. Every thing he was doing seemed right but it turned out there was no cash in his account.“Another woman came in complaining that money was disappearing out of her ac count. When we checked, the withdrawals were all being made late at night and it was finally established that a fami ly member was taking her credit card and using it, while she slept.”Len Laverty retired from the bank in Maclean in 1996. “They wanted to move me somewhere else but I had three young children and I wanted to stay in Maclean,” heIn his retirement, he is involved with church work, notably for St Vincent de Paul in Maclean, and through a former Lions Club mate Terry Cording, with development of the Lawrence Museum, partic ularly its communications exhibits."

It is fitting that we do so, since it is this mother earth which gave her body shape and colour and strength.We know that this is a worthy resting place. With reverence we touch this earth and bless our sister’s body.+WHEN THE CASKET IS PLACED AT THE GRAVEWhilst we entrust this body of flesh to the earth from whence it came we remember the earth’s faithful promise of spring - that from her dark and mysterious richness new and surprising growth abound.This promise has been made clear for us in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who, like Elsie, died and was laid in the earth. We believe, that like Jesus, our sister will come to new life in that same Jesus Christ. While we leave this holy place behind we carry with us the living spirit of Elsie and all those holy men and women who have gone before us and who now live a new and glorious life.Commending their remains to this earth we commend their spirit to all who have loved and now remember them…..CONCLUDING PRAYERLoving and merciful God hear the prayers we offer for our sister Elsie. By her faith and hope she has always been united with you, her Creator. By her generous nature she has been a loving disciple of Jesus Christ. In her strong and enabling love she has lived in your Holy Spirit.Receive her now into the fulness of your presence. Give comfort to all of us who mourn her passing from our midst. For we believe that you will raise us all on the last day.The Laverty Family thank you for your presence here today. We appreciate your prayers, support and friendship, and invite you to refreshments after this celebration atGrafton City Services Bowling Club, Kemp Street (Opposite the family home)."

    "snippet": "EULOGYLeonard James Laverty, the son of Dennis and Nora Laverty, was gifted with life on 10th October, 1911.Sixty-eight years of his life, was spent on the family farm at Taylors Arm on the Nambucca River. It was during his many years of being close to the earth that he developed a deep respect and love for the land, for nature and life itself…Dad was the first to introduce us to God as the Giver of Life…He used our life experiences, the plants and animals to open up for us the meaning of life, birth, growth and death.He enabled us to become aware of the place of gentleness, patience and hope indealing with life around us and with ourselves.My father lived a simple and unpretentious kind of life he worked with dignity and effort, always treating others honestly and generously. For many years, when we lived in Taylor’s Arm, my father took great pride in his vegetable garden. He was very generous in sharing the fruits of his labours with others and was sensitive to those less fortunate than himself.On many occasions, we recall, taking vegetables, fruit, farm produce to school forthe Sisters at the Macksville convent and also for our Parish Priest. Our understanding and awareness of our oneness with others developed from the generosity shown by Dad.At the age of 19, in 1930, my father joined two of his brothers and formed a “Laverty’s Band”. This band proved to be very popular at a lot of dances and balls on the Nambucca River which included Bowraville, Missabotti. Talarm,Utungan, Burrapine, South Arm and the surrounding areas. Dad was very versatile in the band - on some occasions he accompanied hisbrother Denny - a violinist - by vamping on the plano….His official capacity in the band was as a competent drummer; soloist and MC. He also entertained the audience with a “flexi-tone” for waltzes and a “swance whistle” which is similar to a slide trombone.Dad’s love of music was evident in our family life. Many family gatherings, outings and reunions saw my father entertaining the relatives and friends with recitals on the mouth organ, the piano accordian, Jew’s harp. I recall when he was rostered with my mother on the church cleaning at Taylor’s Arm- Mum always cared for the Altar, the linen and flowers. Dad’s job was to clean the body of the Church. He quickly moved through the Church (without lifting or moving any furniture) - then he serenaded to Mum on the organ - playing all his old favourites….I think it would be true to say his favourite instruments were the spoons… (he often played the spoons whilst we waited for dessert to be served - much to Mum’shorror!!) Throughout our family life, we have been blessed to have Dad always there for us.Together, as a family, we have worked through times of grief, brokenness, and thepain of separation in relationships. There have been some occasions when my father struggled with his desires and expectations for his children. He sometimes found his values and beliefs differedfrom his childrens…But, having the openness and freedom within himself to work through this struggle, he came to accept the uniqueness and differences in his eleven children. He was able to give them the space and time to follow their own direction inlife….continue to love them and be there for them. We will always remember Dad for his wonderful sense of humour…In December 1992, we buried Dad’s last brother, John, and afterwards as we shared a cup of tea, many people spoke to Dad, offering their sympathy and several asked Dad if “he was the last in the family” - to which Dad said “Yes” - and they replied. “Well, you take very good care of yourself, Len”. Later I came along to sit with him for awhile and he commented on what people had said to him. I said, well how do you feel Dad, being the last one in the family? He replied - I feel like an “endangered species!! I must add he used to play on being an “endangered species” when Mum wanted some jobs done around the house….!Only recently, on Monday 2nd June, Dad and I were at the doctors surgery. waiting for our turn… Dad turned to and remarked. “You know you can die of old age, waiting at the doctor’s ….” and on another occasion he commented. “You could catch six diseases and get over them while you’re waiting here..”Being a great man of deep faith, his greatest love has been for His God and his Church. His loving relationship with his maker, has been evident in his. faithfulness in praying the rosary, receiving the Sacraments and His living of the Word. Being in communion with his God, enabled Dad to be in a state of readiness when the Son of Man invited him to“Come, you whom my Father has blessed, take for your heritage, the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.May He rest in peace…(Matt 25-34)"

    "snippet": "SirLaverty reunion The Laverty family whose obstinacy gavethe area the separation of Upper and Lower Taylors Arm holds a reunion on Saturday and Sunday. Many of the family are still in the Macleay-Nambucca regions.Others will travel from South Australia, Victoria and Queensland, and even from New Zealand for the reunion, to be held at theMacksville Showground.An open air mass is planned at 9am on Sunday. The Laverty family, with a rather complicated family tree, has as its crest Fortune Favours the Brave but it is not known exactly why labourer, Michael Laverty fled Ballymyhinch, County Down, for England half way through last century.Unusually for his time, he could read and write, and at Chiltern Moor, Cumberland, met and then married at Workington another Catholic, Sarah McCormick.They and three children were assisted migrants when the St Hilda arrived at Port Jackson on February 4, 1865. A brother in law, Auguste Raymonde, was then living at Pola Creek.Family records say they settled at Pola Creek, then (?) near Kinchela, but because of flooding moved to an area to become known as Laverty’s Plains near Taylors Arm in 1884. A son, Dennis Laverty, born at Chiltern and five when they shipped for the colony, and his bride, Nora Goldspring, were to be the first couple married in the old Catholic Church on Wards Farm, the amorous suitor riding 80 miles (129km) to Orara near Coffs Harbour to do his courting. He selected his homestead, Oakvale, in 1883 and built his home in 1902.Around the same time a John Laverty (Snr)selected land near the present Taylors ArmHall. Sam Laverty, a son by a previousmarriage of the immigrant Michael, hadsubsequently followed his father to Australia and selected across the river. When a milk factory was planned a site on Sam’s farm was selected - but he refused to sell and the factory was moved to a site farther upstream to bring the separation of today’sUpper and Lower Taylor’s Arm.Adding further piquancy to the family tree,Dennis Laverty’s Nora was the daughter of an Elizabeth Donnelly (nee Robertson or Ribinson) who had married a John Goldspring - after first being married to a Michael Donnelly, producing two sons. She left her husband because of his drinking and following his death married Goldspring (an Irish builder and the son of a herring fisherman) who had travelled the world and a number of goldfields.Family sources say the family was well off, but were forced to leave Ireland when “the i English confiscated their property, arriving in NSW via the USA.A family book and other memorabilia will be on sale at the reunion.Col LavertyRoy Sanders Street, South West RocksCt"
