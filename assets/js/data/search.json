This color denotes nobility, serenity and peace. It also is associated with the quality of purity, because it withstands the test of fire.The next part of the description is what is on the upper half of the shield. The Laverty shield contains the representation of two lions facing each other in a rampant, combatant pose. The lion, as the king of beasts, signified majesty and kingship from early Roman times. In later use, the lions have become emblematic of strength, courage, and generosity.The lions are holding a human right (dexter) hand that is cut off (couped) at the wrist. The color of the lions and the dexter hand are all red, or gules as used in heraldry. The red represents fortitude and creative power.Another interpretation of the red hand cut off at the wrist is associated with the legend of the “bloody hand of O’Neill”. Several ships were racing toward land, and it had been agreed that the person who first laid his right hand on the shore would lay claim to the land. When O’Neill saw that he was behind in the race, he grabbed a sword, cut off his right hand, and heaved it onto shore ahead of the others to claim the land. Thus, the “bloody” red dexter hand has become a common Irish heraldic symbol of ingenuity.The final part of the description refers to what is in the base, or bottom half, of the shield. The Laverty shield has a boat with 8 oars. From earliest times, the symbol of a boat represented security, stemming from the biblical story of Noah’s Ark. In more modern times, the boat is indicative of venture and travel. The “sable” refers to the black color of the boat, which is associated with night and repentance. The sable color is also attributed to the quality of serenity.source: http://chatterchopz.com/History/coatofarms.htm" }, { "title": "Creating a Daily Surf Rating Report", "url":

with BeautifulSoup Parsing the JSON Data Adding Data to Pandas Data Frame Figuring out Weird Wave and Wind Data Structure Export Dataframe as a HTML Table with CSS Styling Generate Deployment on a Daily Schedule Using Github Action WorkflowIntroductionI like to go to the beach and often find myself checking the Sydney surf forecast at Seabreeze.com.auhttps://www.seabreeze.com.au/weather/wind-forecast/sydneyIt can take a little while to look at each day and use my mouse to hover over the chart to see wind speed and wave height etc and check the second chart for swell period and direction.I wanted to see if I could write a script that would scrape this data for me, put it into a table, apply my personal surf condition preferences to the table and also filter out days where the surf was bad and make it accessible on this website, the end result is this report :https://alexlaverty.github.io/surf/index.htmlGreen is good, red is bad, the more green cells on a row, the better the conditions will be.Choosing a Programming LanguageThis script could be written using various programming languages, I am currently learning Python so I have chosen it to write the script, Python also has the Pandas library at our disposal which is pretty powerful.Scraping Forecast Data with BeautifulSoupTo get started we will scrape the surf forecast data using the python library BeautifulSoup.This snippet of code will connect to the Seabreeze forecast for Sydney and retrieve the websites HTML code :from bs4 import BeautifulSoupimport requests url = &quot;https://www.seabreeze.com.au/weather/wind-forecast/sydney&quot;page = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, &quot;html.parser&quot;)print(soup)Copy and paste this view-source link into your chrome browser to see what that html code looks like :view-source:https://www.seabreeze.com.au/weather/wind-forecast/sydneyParsing the JSON DataScrolling through the HTML I can see a bunch of interesting data embedded in JSON value in var json={} :Using regex I grab script instances that match the text with the following expression var json={.*};I was having trouble parsing this text as JSON so had to do some string replacing to get it working,I’m sure there’s a better regex expression that could exactly match what I needed, but that can be a future improvement.# Needs a better regex expressionpattern = re.compile(r&#39;var json={.*};&#39;, re.DOTALL)script = soup.find(&#39;script&#39;, text=pattern)data = pattern.search(script.text).group(0)# tidies beginning and end of json string so json.loads works correctlydata = data.replace(&quot;var json=&quot;, &quot;&quot;)data = data.replace(&quot;};&quot;, &quot;}&quot;)self.json = json.loads(data)Once we’ve extracted the JSON properly we have something like this to

The bank robber came many years later when Len was assistant man ager at the Commonwealth Bank branch in Maclean.Raised at Taylors Arm, near Macksville, Len was 15 when he finished school in 1960 and a few weeks later started work with the Commonwealth Bank.“There were no vacancies in the bank at Macksville, so they sent me to Sydney to the bank’s head office in Martin Place,” Len recalls.“There were probably around 500 people working at head office and I was right down in the dungeons with the old records. By law in those days banks had to keep cheques and records for seven years and we would spend each day filing the new ones and discarding those that were no longer needed….pret ty boring work down in the basement.”There were ups and downs, up to the first floor to where mail was processed and cheques dispatched to other banks and branches on ex changes, then down to the bills and overseassection where much of the work involved foreign ex change transactions and tra veller’s cheques.“This was in the early 60s when anyone travelling over seas had to take travellers’ cheques and currency for the country they were going to,” says Len. “There was an ex change at Sydney airport, - a little section no bigger than your average kitchen-and the banks used to staff it on a month-about basis.“Somebody had to be there for every plane that came in or went out. Sometimes the day would start at 5 am and the last plane would not come in until 11 pm.“I was only 19 and it was pretty exciting to meet people like Alan Davidson, who ac tually worked for the bank. I had a bit to do with him and met others like Don Lane and Jack Brabham passing through the airport” But Len was keen to leave the big smoke trans and applied and was accepted. for work with the bank in Papua New Guinea.He was appointed to the branch being established at Kieta on Bougainville Island when the copper mine was opening, one of many overseas workers servicing the project. With “seven or eight” other single male bank employees he lived in what had been a plantation manager’s cottage on the coconut plantation that turned into a mine site.“I was there 12 months, - more than enough,” he recalls. “There was nothing to do in non-working hours except drink or go swim ming.”The second half of his overseas posting was spent at the bank’s Port Moresby branch “a much more sociable situation”.Travel around PNG was virtually all by air, small plane or helicopter, in relatively unsophisticated aircraft and primitive flying conditions. One flight from Rabaul to Kieta seemed likely to end in disaster when thick cloud closed in and without radar or lights, the pilot was unable to find his landing strip. “We circled around for half an hour or more until through a tiny break in the clouds he spotted the airfield. Were we re lieved,” says Len.Back in Australia, Len worked on relieving staff around Sydney branches, re-acquainting himself with general branch activities and routine.“No computers of course, all the balances, monthly interest payments etc calculated with an adding machine and an accounting machine.“June was the big mon th… interest would have to go into the savings accounts and we would try to get that all finished by the middle of the month. Now you just have to press a button and that in formation is all there on com puter.”Computers were the coming thing in banking when Len was appointed to relieving staff at Wagga Wagga in the early 1970s. The city had two Commonwealth Bank branch es, total staff around 45, and the main branch was an agen cy for the Reserve Bank, col lecting old bank notes to be cancelled and distributing anything up to $100,000 a week in new currency to other banks.Even with such large amounts of cash on hand, in those more relaxed times security was not a major con cern.“We didn’t actually have any ‘security” Len recalls. “It all took place in a locked room and the officers were issued with pistols. The skill we had with them, they were probably more a danger than a help. “In the end Irefused to carry one at all.” Len was to stay in Wagga Wagga for 12 years, rising to the rank of assistant manag er before he and wife Wendy decided to bring their three daughters to Maclean where he was appoint ed assistant manager.Today Len and Wendy’s daughters, Carol, Terese (Mrs Rick Woollett) and Lenice, all live in Klama, home too, for two young grandchildren.In truth Len missed most of the action in the March 10, 1988 hold-up of the Maclean branch.“It was lunch time and I had walked out the back of the bank when the robber came In Just one man, they said he was armed.The next day’s Daily Exa miner reported the robbery and a police claim that the robber was carrying a saw-off shotgun concealed inside a shopping bag.“When I came back into the bank the feller was shaking and he said I’ve been robbed,” says Len.“As far as the thief was concerned it was a case of wrong time, wrong teller. There were two tellers on duty, one on general transac tions and the other, the one he demanded money from, count ing cash from a kid’s piggy bank. The bandit would have got very little for his trou ble…. the other teller would have had much more.”Witnesses gave police a description of the getaway car and thief was quickly traced to Ballina and arrested. “Banking certainly changedduring my career,” says Len. “In the early days after work we would go to the club or pub for a few drinks… and do a lot of business while you were there. There was more gentlemanly co-operation between the banks in those days, too.“When ATMs came to Ma clean in the early 1980s bank staff had to educate ourselves and the public to use them. There were funny stories.“One fellow came in quite upset because the ATM would not give him a pay-out. Every thing he was doing seemed right but it turned out there was no cash in his account.“Another woman came in complaining that money was disappearing out of her ac count. When we checked, the withdrawals were all being made late at night and it was finally established that a fami ly member was taking her credit card and using it, while she slept.”Len Laverty retired from the bank in Maclean in 1996. “They wanted to move me somewhere else but I had three young children and I wanted to stay in Maclean,” heIn his retirement, he is involved with church work, notably for St Vincent de Paul in Maclean, and through a former Lions Club mate Terry Cording, with development of the Lawrence Museum, partic ularly its communications exhibits." }, { "title": "Funeral Eucharist Elsie Pearl Laverty", "url": "/funeral-eucharist-elsie-laverty/", "categories": "Laverty Family History", "tags": "reunion, Elsie Pearl McGree", "date": "2002-04-12 13:33:00 +1000", "snippet": "FUNERAL EUCHARIST IN THANKSGIVINGfor the life ofElsie Pearl Laverty1924 - 2002ST.

It is fitting that we do so, since it is this mother earth which gave her body shape and colour and strength.We know that this is a worthy resting place. With reverence we touch this earth and bless our sister’s body.+WHEN THE CASKET IS PLACED AT THE GRAVEWhilst we entrust this body of flesh to the earth from whence it came we remember the earth’s faithful promise of spring - that from her dark and mysterious richness new and surprising growth abound.This promise has been made clear for us in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who, like Elsie, died and was laid in the earth. We believe, that like Jesus, our sister will come to new life in that same Jesus Christ. While we leave this holy place behind we carry with us the living spirit of Elsie and all those holy men and women who have gone before us and who now live a new and glorious life.Commending their remains to this earth we commend their spirit to all who have loved and now remember them…..CONCLUDING PRAYERLoving and merciful God hear the prayers we offer for our sister Elsie.

It is not jealous…It is not rude, it does not seek its own interests-It bears all things, hopes all things, endures all things… Love never fails..May she rest in peace." }, { "title": "McGree Family Truly Upheld ANZAC Spirit", "url": "/mcgree-family-truly-upheld-anzac-spirit/", "categories": "Laverty Family History", "tags": "Patrick McGree, John McGree", "date": "1999-09-30 00:00:00 +1000", "snippet": "McGree family truly upheld ANZAC SpiritIf ANY family understood the sacrifices of ANZAC was the McGrees of Taylors Arm.

He fell Chunuk Bair, the highest point ANZACS reached Gallipoli and where today impressive stone monument records names more than 800 officers men of NZEF who died 1915 and who have known grave, including the brave boy from Taylors Arm.John Ambrose McGree, born 1892, signed on for duty with Australian Imperial Force just 18 days after Patrick had fallen and left Australia with the Infantry Battalion, 1 Reinforcements, five days after Christmas 1915 aboard HMAT Medic.The 22-year-old’s enlistment papers describe him as fit with “fresh. complexion”, good eyesight, 5 feet inches (174 centimetres) tall and 126 pounds (57 kilograms)-in other words, young, lean and keen-ideal attributes for soldier. John stepped ashore Alexandria on March 29, 1916 and then went straight to the front, disembarking Marseilles six days later. Taken on strength into the Battalion at Étaples, John sustained gunshot wounds to the back chest on July 25,1916 and, sadly, died of his wounds the next day. He was buried Warloy-Baillon Military Cemetery in the Somme by war chaplain, Reverend Samuel J Gosling. A heartbroken Mrs McGree wrote to Army Base Records in Melbourne on August 29 asking for details of his death and burial and if anyone knew “what were his last words”.On July 18, 1918, Michael Dennis McGree, born 1890, was killed in action in France whilst fighting for the NZEF and buried in Gommecourt Wood New Cemetery, Foncquevillers. At the time, Michael was reported as missing action. While awaiting news about his fate, McGree fractured a rib in a sulky accident and was taken to Kempsey Hospital. She suffered more pain than mother should bear.REMEMBERED: The McGree brothers are named on the War Memorials at both Taylors Arm.

It was during his many years of being close to the earth that he developed a deep respect and love for the land, for nature and life itself…Dad was the first to introduce us to God as the Giver of Life…He used our life experiences, the plants and animals to open up for us the meaning of life, birth, growth and death.He enabled us to become aware of the place of gentleness, patience and hope indealing with life around us and with ourselves.My father lived a simple and unpretentious kind of life he worked with dignity and effort, always treating others honestly and generously. For many years, when we lived in Taylor’s Arm, my father took great pride in his vegetable garden. He was very generous in sharing the fruits of his labours with others and was sensitive to those less fortunate than himself.On many occasions, we recall, taking vegetables, fruit, farm produce to school forthe Sisters at the Macksville convent and also for our Parish Priest. Our understanding and awareness of our oneness with others developed from the generosity shown by Dad.At the age of 19, in 1930, my father joined two of his brothers and formed a “Laverty’s Band”. This band proved to be very popular at a lot of dances and balls on the Nambucca River which included Bowraville, Missabotti. Talarm,Utungan, Burrapine, South Arm and the surrounding areas. Dad was very versatile in the band - on some occasions he accompanied hisbrother Denny - a violinist - by vamping on the plano….His official capacity in the band was as a competent drummer; soloist and MC. He also entertained the audience with a “flexi-tone” for waltzes and a “swance whistle” which is similar to a slide trombone.Dad’s love of music was evident in our family life. Many family gatherings, outings and reunions saw my father entertaining the relatives and friends with recitals on the mouth organ, the piano accordian, Jew’s harp. I recall when he was rostered with my mother on the church cleaning at Taylor’s Arm- Mum always cared for the Altar, the linen and flowers. Dad’s job was to clean the body of the Church. He quickly moved through the Church (without lifting or moving any furniture) - then he serenaded to Mum on the organ - playing all his old favourites….I think it would be true to say his favourite instruments were the spoons… (he often played the spoons whilst we waited for dessert to be served - much to Mum’shorror!!) Throughout our family life, we have been blessed to have Dad always there for us.Together, as a family, we have worked through times of grief, brokenness, and thepain of separation in relationships. There have been some occasions when my father struggled with his desires and expectations for his children. He sometimes found his values and beliefs differedfrom his childrens…But, having the openness and freedom within himself to work through this struggle, he came to accept the uniqueness and differences in his eleven children. He was able to give them the space and time to follow their own direction inlife….continue to love them and be there for them. We will always remember Dad for his wonderful sense of humour…In December 1992, we buried Dad’s last brother, John, and afterwards as we shared a cup of tea, many people spoke to Dad, offering their sympathy and several asked Dad if “he was the last in the family” - to which Dad said “Yes” - and they replied. “Well, you take very good care of yourself, Len”. Later I came along to sit with him for awhile and he commented on what people had said to him. I said, well how do you feel Dad, being the last one in the family? He replied - I feel like an “endangered species!! I must add he used to play on being an “endangered species” when Mum wanted some jobs done around the house….!Only recently, on Monday 2nd June, Dad and I were at the doctors surgery. waiting for our turn… Dad turned to and remarked. “You know you can die of old age, waiting at the doctor’s ….” and on another occasion he commented. “You could catch six diseases and get over them while you’re waiting here..”Being a great man of deep faith, his greatest love has been for His God and his Church. His loving relationship with his maker, has been evident in his. faithfulness in praying the rosary, receiving the Sacraments and His living of the Word. Being in communion with his God, enabled Dad to be in a state of readiness when the Son of Man invited him to“Come, you whom my Father has blessed, take for your heritage, the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.May He rest in peace…(Matt 25-34)" }, { "title": "Big Is Beautiful For Family", "url": "/big-is-beautiful-for-family/", "categories": "Laverty Family History", "tags": "laverty", "date": "1993-10-04 00:00:00 +1000", "snippet": "Daily ExaminerTHE DAILY EXAMINER, Monday, October 4, 1993.Big is beautiful for familyGRAFTON’S Len and Elsie Laverty, (back left) were the surprised centres of attention at a family gathering planned for their 50th wedding anniversary by their 11 children.Grand-children (from left) Aaron, Jason, Andrew, Alex, Melissa, Andrea and Michael were among the 50-odd Laverty family members celebrating the day.

The Laverty family, with a rather complicated family tree, has as its crest Fortune Favours the Brave but it is not known exactly why labourer, Michael Laverty fled Ballymyhinch, County Down, for England half way through last century.Unusually for his time, he could read and write, and at Chiltern Moor, Cumberland, met and then married at Workington another Catholic, Sarah McCormick.They and three children were assisted migrants when the St Hilda arrived at Port Jackson on February 4, 1865. A brother in law, Auguste Raymonde, was then living at Pola Creek.Family records say they settled at Pola Creek, then (?) near Kinchela, but because of flooding moved to an area to become known as Laverty’s Plains near Taylors Arm in 1884. A son, Dennis Laverty, born at Chiltern and five when they shipped for the colony, and his bride, Nora Goldspring, were to be the first couple married in the old Catholic Church on Wards Farm, the amorous suitor riding 80 miles (129km) to Orara near Coffs Harbour to do his courting. He selected his homestead, Oakvale, in 1883 and built his home in 1902.Around the same time a John Laverty (Snr)selected land near the present Taylors ArmHall. Sam Laverty, a son by a previousmarriage of the immigrant Michael, hadsubsequently followed his father to Australia and selected across the river. When a milk factory was planned a site on Sam’s farm was selected - but he refused to sell and the factory was moved to a site farther upstream to bring the separation of today’sUpper and Lower Taylor’s Arm.Adding further piquancy to the family tree,Dennis Laverty’s Nora was the daughter of an Elizabeth Donnelly (nee Robertson or Ribinson) who had married a John Goldspring - after first being married to a Michael Donnelly, producing two sons. She left her husband because of his drinking and following his death married Goldspring (an Irish builder and the son of a herring fisherman) who had travelled the world and a number of goldfields.Family sources say the family was well off, but were forced to leave Ireland when “the i English confiscated their property, arriving in NSW via the USA.A family book and other memorabilia will be on sale at the reunion.Col LavertyRoy Sanders Street, South West RocksCt" }, { "title": "Laverty reunion starts tomorrow", "url": "/laverty-reunion-starts-tomorrow/", "categories": "Laverty Family History", "tags": "reunion", "date": "1989-12-12 00:00:00 +1100", "snippet": "One of the district’s best known families, the Lavertys, are staging a family reunion at the Macksville Showground thisweekend.

Laverty’s of Limerick By Jane Laverty A SPECIAL PLACE. ODE TO CHARLES When I agreed to compile this book in readiness for the Laverty Re-union which will be held in October of 1989, 1 had little idea about the breadth of information it would contain. I knew there would be lots to record since the “Taylors Arm” Laverty’s to which I belong, all were good Catholic breaders with large families. I was unaware of The “Limerick” Lavertys and the “Nhill” Lavertys (as I have come to dub them on the computer files), and of the various paths. their lives have taken.From my work it has become obvious that there are some fundamental qualities which pervade the family. That seems to be a wit which reveals itself in story telling; a basic hard working drive which overcomes enormous odds; and a great pride in being part of the clan.It has almost become a standing joke in my own family that everytime anyone does anything praiseworthy the catchery will be “Of course..She’s/He’s a Laverty!”. We grew up with. that encouragement and pride being described to us by our Father. There was never ever any expectation that we would fail at anything we set our sights upon. I am very grateful for that belief in myself and my own worth which was passed on to me by my Father because “ I was a Laverty”.I believe that while times have changed, and while we may seem occassionally to wonder if the old ways were better, that the Lavertys of our present generation are possessive of the same qualities that have distinguished our family for generations. We are still quickwitted and love a good story: we still give our all to the work we do whether it is on the land, in business, in the arts, or in services to our community; and we still are proud of who we are… The Laverty Clan.Should I have overlooked any of the material that wassubmitted for publication I make apologies. This compilationhas been a substantial task. Hopefully if may be the “first draft” of a more comprehensive History which someone else may tackle for the future. Thanks needs to be placed to my Father for his persistent questioning about how the book was coming along, even if my answers were often curt and sometimes unprintable; to myAunts Dorothy and Noreen who have been the primaryorganizers and movers of this mammoth event; and to mydaughter Michelle for her assistance with the cartoons andgraphics which I hope will add an individual flavour to the text. I would like to dedicate my efforts in this venture to my sister, Toni, who was tragically taken from us in April of this year. She was excited about the prospect of the ru-union and was responsible for the invitations which youhave recieved.Carol (Laverty) Harris.FORWARD;My first real interest in tracing my Family Tree began, I think, on the day of 6-7-1982.. On that day, my Mother spent most of the day at our home. She talked all through lunch and the afternoon about her childhood, her parents; Dad’s family of her growing up in the Daweson Valley in Queensland where she met Dad working in the Cotton Fields. Then as a young bride of eighteen she came to settle at Taylor’s Arm never to see her parents again.All afternoon she talked, as if she had not told useverything, reluctant to go home - as if she would remembersomething else. Little did we know that it was to be ourlast talk together. My mother was getting ready for Mass afew hours later when God called her home.How I wish I could remember all she and Dad had told me overthe years. So on behalf of my Sister Noreen and her family: my brother Colin and his Daughters Carol and Toni; My Cousin Angela who has provided the paintings; to our Partners for their patience and tolerance; and to my Daughter Kathryn, I dedicate this book to My Parents; to all our Parents; Our Ansestors.It is to those that we pay tribute for our start in life,for by their hard work and their faith they instilled in us.Through their endurance they provided a sound basis for A better life for us their families. So many of them had to leave Ireland and England, because of petty ideals; their land was taken from them and they fledto Australia to make a new start. To them we owe a debt of thanks and gratitude. So this bookis for them, compiled with love, and memories, many hours of working and searching, and many sleepless nights.I hope it is worthy of them. Dorothy (Laverty) Clarke.THE ORIGIN OF THE NAME: “LAVERTY”.The original name of O’Flaithbhearthaig comes down to us asFlaherty or Laverty, with or without the “0”.The O’Flahertys possessed the territory on the east side of Lough Corrib until the thirteenth century when, under pressure from the Anglo-Norman penetration into Connacht, they moved westward to the other side of the lake and settled there.The chieftancy continued until the beginning of the eighteenth century. British statistics show that the Flaherty’s and O’Flahertys are still much more numerous in their original habitat, County Galway than anywhere else. The same surname is found in Ulster, but there the initial “F” is aspirated thus altering the pronunciation and producing the form O”Laverty, which approximates phonetically to the aspirated Irish form. The scept was regarded as distinct from the Galway one, and was centred on County Donegal.There have been some interesting replies from people all over the country, and some from overseas who bear the Laverty name. While it is possible that there are connections in the line back in The Ireland of the early 1800’s, I have not been able to see these from the information provided here. However this is all included in the hope that someone out there may decide to take up the task of tracing back and recognizing the origins of us all. I quote verbatum from the letters that have arrived.Collection of Letters“Dear Sister Denise,Sister Leonie gave me you address a long time ago so you can see how good I am at writing letters. However, I had just had to take this opportunity of sending you a card to let you know there are laverty’s in this part of the countryalso. (Ontario, Canada). I am the only girl among five bays. My parents (Peter and Bridget) are both dead. My youngest brother is 67. I may as well send you my picture also, a poor one that youcan now tear up. I am in my seventieth year. This picture was taken last year. Be assured of my prayers that you may have a joyous and Blessed Christmas.We have some snow only today. Love in ChristSister Mary Laverty.I.B.V.M.22 Kent Avenue, Brahma Lodge.South Australia.5109.I was born in Downpatrick County Down Ireland. My wife Moira Clare was born in Lisburn, County Down. For the last six years we remained in Ireland we lived in a fishing village called Araglass which is seven miles from Downpatrick and thirty miles from Belfast. This is where we met and married. We came to Australia in 1956 and settled in Adelaide. We have six children, all of whom were born in Adelaide. They range in ane from 20 35 and are named: Patrick, Keiron, Catherine, gerald, Damoon, and Ronan. My father and Grandfather were born Townland of Leganaddy which is four miles from Downpatrick.Oliver Laverty.P.O. Box 32, Miles. Qld. 4415. June 29, 1989.Dear Mrs Clarke,My Father in law passed on the Laverty family reunion registration form and enclosed notes on the Lavertys, and on your family in particular. He said he had written to you but. has not as yet heard back. I have put the family particulars in the Old and VictorianGenealogical Society journals but have not got anywhere. Areall the Laverty’s in N.S.W.??My husband was born at Corryong in Victoria. His father is Harold Francis Laverty, mother Norma Jean nee Nugent. His Grandfather was Andrew Francis Laverty, born 1876 in Singleton and married Grace Henrietta Hempenstall. His great Grandfather was James Laverty born 1846 at Heidelberg and who married Agnes Boyd. His Great Great GrandFather was also James and was born in Ireland. He married Elizabeth Dunlop in Ireland but all their children were born inAustralia. This James was born circa 1810. His father wasalso James Laverty, a farmer, but mother’s name unknownaccording to his death certificate. Anyway James andElizabeth had seven children. They were John, Elizabeth,James, Joseph, Robert, and William living in 1894 when theirFather died, and Sarah Anne was deceased by then. I don’tknow anything about any apart from James.My Father-in-law knew little about his family and thoughtthat the James who married Agnes Boyd was the first to come. to Australia. The family story is that he was a guard on a convict ship. Possible his Father was the quard but I can’t find any evidence for this, or for that matter, against it. It seems odd that there isn’t any known decendants of James’ brothers John, Joseph, Robert or William, known to the family. In 1894 they were aged from 33 to 58 years. As my in-laws didn’t come to Queensland until 1946, have relatives in Victoria, and visit occassionally, it isn’t as if there has been a breakdown in communication. Unless they didn’t marry, and just died out that way, it would seem there must be some decendants somewhere and it would be nice to find them.We cannot unfortunately, attend the reunion, but I hope it is a successful one for you all. We were at Singleton over the Easter week-end to attend a Squire reunion- my Mother was a Squire. We have four school aged children - one in year 12- and this reunion is in our school term. Yours sincerely Patricia A. Laverty.This exert came attached to the above letter and is a resume from Harold Francis Laverty who is Patricia’s Father-in-law.“I was born at Albury (3/9/10) and lived at Birringanna. district midway between Tallangatta and Corryong. My wife lived here and was born on the First of March, 1914. We were married on 23, April, 1934. and celebrated our 55th Wedding Anniversary last month.We have two sons Laurie (24/5/35), and Max (6/6/36). My Great Grandfather James was born in Northern Ireland. My Grandfather was born in Heidelberg near Melbourne. He was a policeman and worked at Melbourne and Singleton. I resided in Melbourne and served in the Field Artillery 27 pounder and gained the rank of Sergent. I served for four and a half years and was discharged on 1/1/46. We then moved to Miles Queensland.I have found amongst the pieces of information that were handed to me a family tree which traces a connection between Robert Haswell and Elizabeth Francis. It contains no dates. and has affixed to it The following Note “Joseph Bernett Laverty left Hertleport 1926 andcame to New Zealand. He was a ships engineer. They were Gospel and Anglicant. My Mother Susan Devlin, is a Roman Catholic and all six children. that she and my father had are likewise. So it looks as though we have come full circleSr. Joanna (Maurya Laverty,”The data shows the following information: Robert and Elizabeth’s daughter married a Michael Laverty. They in Lurn had two children Hanna and James. James married Hannah Leonard and produced six children. The Joseph Bernett referred to in the above note was the second of these and appears to be Sr Joanna’s Grandfather. Joseph married H.Lister and she bore him seven children. The second last of these was a set of twins. The oldest, Joseph, carried. Sup Devlin, the mother referred to above. I am uncertain of where this information originated from and just how it fits the overall pattern, but I have included it in case it fills a gap for someone reading these documents.Dur Story.Denis, Catherine and Sarah Laverty arrived with their parents, Michael and Sarah, (who was a sister to John McCormack) on the St Hilda in 1856. Michael and Sarah had been married at Workington. They had been forced to flee Ireland and lived in England for a ti before coming to Australia. They had a brother-in-law,Auguste Raymonde, living at Polar Creek, Port Macquarie, and that is where they went after arriving in Sydney. They stayed there until they decided to purchase land Taylors Arm. The area is still known as Laverty’s Plains, and is still owned by Lavertys today. Michael had been married previously and had a son sam, who later followed him to Taylors Arm. Michael and Sarah had six children: Michael, Denis, Mary Anne, John, Catherine and Sarah. atSam and Sarah never married, and it is the descendents ofthe remaining five which this history traces.The older Lavertys were mostly farmers, bushmen and builders. They used to cut their own sleepers from the trees they fell, which they then cut into slabs with a broad axe. Many a time I helped my Dad use the wedges and crowbar to split posts and timber. I can still see him making his own boats; how we used to stoke the copper up to keep the water boiling to bend the planks. Then the copper would be used to boil the bark from the trees to stain the nets a dark colour. Dad always said the darker the net, the mare fish you caught. One day Dad arrived home pushing the bike with a big Jew fish hanging from the front handlebars, and dangling over the back wheels. I can still see that fish. Dad had a big grin that morning.There are still today Builders and Fisherman amongst us, but our numbers now include such diverse occupations as Teachers; Lawyers; Nuns; Priests; Doctors; Upholsterers; Draftsmen and Scientists. We still seem to maintain an interest in music, and there is part of the story teller in us all.“Dear Sarah,Granny Laverty was born in the same place as John McCormack the singer. The anly McCormicks who lived there were Granny’s cousins. When Granny left that part of Ireland she was married to a tall Irish man, Michael Laverty. It seems he had three brothers. Dad told me that he thought. two of them went to America, and that possibly the third came toAustralia. But they never heard from them at all. Granny and Grandfather went to England. They stayed there a while and then came to Australia. At that time Dad was about two years old. He was running around with the sailors and fell down a port hole and needed seven stitches in his head. He had white hair and his brothers used to call him a little Pom. Dad used to tell them straight he was no Pommie. He would tell them if a cat had kittens in a oven you would notcall them loaves of broad. When they came to Australia first they lived at Polar Creek near the Macleay (Kempsey) then later selected farming land on the Nambucca River at Taylors Arm. One brother of Grandfather’s stayed in England by all accounts. Grandfather never knew. Leo Flemming, our cousin, met the Laverly family in England during the first world war. There were twins in the family so that seems to follow.suit in the Lavertys here also. Yes, I recieved your letter which was a long time getting here. Grandfather Laver ty died in Kempsey an ulcer burst in his stomach. Granny lived until she was 96. Aunty Sarah looked after her. love (ramPat and Leo”Michael Andrew LavertyMichael Andrew Laverty was born August 26, 1909, the son of Michael and Catherine Laverty. He was educated at Taylors Arm and Bowraville. After he married he and Edna lived for short time with Michel’s parents until their own house was completed. aMike, as he was known, dairy farmed all his life, rearingsheep and pigs as well. The cows were originally milked byhand before machinery was installed.Butter milk was pumped from the local butter factory,through pipes, to large vats at the pig styes. A whistle would be blown to notify that the milk was on its way. Some years later he bought a second farm, share farming it until Alan was able to take it over. A third farm was bought from Rhupert Flemming across from where the old Medlow school was. Son Pat, and wife Mary, took over the running of this property. Mike was a keen axemen, taking an interest in the woodchops at the local rodeos and shows. He loved helping people. One particular instance comes to mind. A couple from Sydney had a canoe and were camping near the bridge. It set in to rain. and the creeks were rising. So Mike went and bought themhome and they stayed a week. He was proud of his religion; the rosary would be said every night after tea, mostly before the washing up was done. His pride and joy was his car, a 1929 Dodge, which was cleaned after each use. After the sudden death of his wife his health suffered and he declined noticably. He moved from Laverty’s Plains to the village of Taylors Arm, and died shortly afterwards on December 2, 1975.Denis Laverty married Nora Goldspring, and were the first to be joined in that union in the old Church on Wards farm. Before they were married, Denis used to ride from Taylors Arm to Orara (West of Coffs Harbour) to visit Nora, a distance of B0 miles. The site of the homestead “Oakville” was selected by Denis on 4-10-1883, and the house was built in 1902John, meanwhile selected land near the present Taylors Arm hall. Sam selected across the river. When the milk factory was to be built a site was selected at Lower Taylors Arm on Sam’s property. But Sam refused to sell the land and another site was chosen further up, hence the separation of the township…upper and lower Taylors Arm.MY CHILDHOOD DAYS By Dorothy (Laverty) ClarkeMy first memories are of going to Mass and the Missions. How I loved those sermons. They made you sit up and think. No swear words in those days. I bet a lot of you still rememberFr. Goss. My first day at school was a disaster, crying for big brother Col, and chewing my hankie up until it was in pieces.I can still see my mother washing at the well, always with a wet apron, from scrubbing on the washing board. How her knuckles must have hurt. Whoever was the baby used to sit or sleep in a big box, used for packing bananas. The clothes line was a wire line strung up between the camphor laurel trees, propped up with a big stick, or pole, (clothes prop).I’ll always remember Dad for his singing around the open fire, and how we always had a winner for the best singer, and I only realised as I grew older, that each one had a turn at winning that sixpence! That was first prize! Dad used to borrow a truck from Jack Chapman once a month to take us to the crossing for a swim, and the best part was. having an ice cream at Petros (now Big Jim’s) on the way home. We all had a share of the yard to keep clean, and we took so much pride in doing just that. We used to go over near the railway line each afternoon to fetch a load of wood or brambles (small wood). We would go home from school and have our bread and syrup or jam, do our jobs, and then play in our cubby house, mostly built amongst the wattle trees ar lantana bushes. Dad used to make us toys from small pieces of wood, like trucks, aeroplanes and dolls out of pegs. He always carried a pocket knife in his pocket, and you could see him whittling away.DOROTHY CLARKE.Times used to be very hard, and they had to clear the virgin land with horses, sythes, brush hooks, cross cut saws and all rough tools. They would plant their crops and so many time see the bandicoot or wallaby or wild pigs destroy them. They grew a lot of pumpkin, potato and corn. They all huntedand went after pigeon and wild turkey. with my Dad, they went to Burrapine to Even and Lizzy Kirkmans. When they pulled up Bede thought he was outside St Mary’s Cathederal as they were saying the Litany, and all they could hear from outside was the chorus “Pray for us” “Pray for us”.Dorothy Laverty Clarke.Another true story is when our Mum, Florrie, won a cow in Church raffle. She traded her in for a washing machine. The electricity had only been on for a few months and I suppose mum thought that with eleven children the machine would be. worth more in the long run.Norm Poole often laughed later as he said Mum did not know.the cow was with calf. That made news in an English Journal! The cow was originally donated by Mr Ted Metz and I am pleased to say we are good friends with he and his wifetoday. After that incident, we always kept a house cow anyway. For some reason or other they seemed to always be called Winnie, or Fairy or Daisy.Dorothy Clarke.1 well remember the war coupons. Many a time I lost them and did we get into trouble! I recall going to Reedy’s (now the Dunhi vol and was so shy about going into the shop. I would way to my sister, Noreen, “You go in, it’s your turn.” After auch arquing we would go in together!. I can still remember the day I tore the coupons up and Mr Reedy would not accept Uom. If only he knew the trouble that caused! I still think of those days forty odd years later and the memories are very clear.We used to go to Bobby Hodges for a billy of milk. On one articuler day I arrived at the big jacaranda tree, and went Lo Cake the hankle from around the handle, only to see the Bill yoll down the hill. manures of childhood are happy ones. I only regret not aking more notice when my parents were telling me things of b ulliy, Laverty Clarke.FOR MY NAN By Florrie LavertyIf there is one portrait in the gallery of my memory that lives more than the others it is that of my Grandfather.The reflections that bounce from that mirrorare endless.I watched as the days haul was bought home, and the scrawny lobster poked its feelers over the unfamiliar concrete And eagerly pulled the gut from the fish to show I was of the same caste. And later, in an unfamiliar bed, the reassurance and security of the warmth of an Irish song soft and comforting.There was Eustie with his sack for naughty children …so we believed…and his bottle of wine. Long after, found dead in his shack.. three daysunnoticed.My Grandfather must have the largestrepetoir of tall stories of any person I know, and even the mischevious glint of the boy long gonecannot detract from the credibility.There are two distinctive landmarksabout my Grandfather one is the early styled grey flannel shirt,and the other is his sandshoes.But these are only parts of the dregs of tobacco which fall to the floor from a roll your own; or the buts which burn down on the windowsill and floor while he watches the world from his silver pearch.We went to “work” and sat on the edge of a graveside, and hemeasured and dug.And we talked about ripening bananas, and hid while the funeral service was on… So we could fill in the hole later on.There has always been a gentleness.he tried to disguise.I saw it with the birth of my child.Post Script.Now you are goneand there is a space in the gallery that isBurning and botomless. Like losing a limb.But I can see you, and hear you and watch you wink as you roarfor another pot of tea, and paint the kitchen the week before Christmas.You cannot escape.There is a seed that grows and preserves you and it lives in our imaginationand laughs, and chuckles, andbellows with enjoyment. And you shake your fist at the shadowy figurebeckoning you to leave us.But your spirit is in us and in our childrenAnd you will never die.Carol Laverty Harris.Michael Stephen LavertyIn memory of Pop, Michael Stephen Laverty, who departed this life May 6, 1977. Written by Linda Fuller when aged twelve. years.We still see him quite clearly. As though he still were hereand sometimes when we think of him We shed a little tear. But we always go on loving him Like we always did And although we are all growing up Back then when we were kids. So God please look after him From all his family and me So when in turn our last days come Again our Pop we’ll see.FOR MICHAEL STEPHEN LAVERTY, MY POP.By Stephen F. Clarke.I’m writing from the toilet; hey it’s a great place to You can gather up your thoughts, if you can just handle thethink stink.I’d like to tell you about Pop, of his family and glory. A really great man, who could sure tell a story.Now Pop had a mate, Chappie the Plumber, Well this pair had gone swimming at the beach down at Gumma. Well Pop had swum out, and Chappie for a bit of a lark, Thought “1’11 scare me old mate”, so he yelled out “look! Shark”Well, pop thought he was kidding, so he gave a wave and a grin, But his face turned to terror when he soon saw the fin.And the shark headed for him.. It had to be thirty feet ormore And do you know? My pop beat the shark to the shore.I’d just sit there and listenWithout making a sound.Fair Dinkum! My Pop had to be the best swimmer around!Then there was this bloke, a McKay I think, Who would often tell Pop how he could handle a drink. Well Pop thought he’d show him, he’d bring him undone A contest he thought and we’ll go one for one. So after drinking for hours, McKay’s speech became slurred. His eyes were all red. Everything was a blur. After drinking all day, McKay he did drop And the winner declared was my dear sober pop.I’d just sit there and listenWithout making a sound. Fair Dinkum! My Pop had to be the best drinker around.My memories of Pop, are that of a boy’s.Unspoilt memories, like old favourite toys. And that’s the way it should stay, memories that were never boring. A bloke I called Pop.He could sure tell a story!Linoleum and Love(For Michael and Florence Laverty, my Grandparents)They were older then, like their kitchen floor,linoleum and love worn together moreby each treading heart. They were never sure: Had they found happiness, or simply a way to endure?My Grandfather’s faithfulness was tough and taciturn.Builder and fisherman, he did not learnpatience, except for fish. He’d hook his fingers in the air,alive with cigarettes, and catch its burning as ashes in his hair. His eyes were full of stories we never dareddisbelieve. Looking back, I know he cared,at least as best he could,his hands hard with working over water and wood. Every time we visited, my grandmother gave us scraps. “For the dogs”, she’d say.Staying in love; knowing how to save,make a little go a long way.Such a brave economy of motion. It was the best lesson my grandmother taught,something we might lean on. knowing how she’d foughther way into believing. Her rough inuckled rosary, her tea-towel with its thin-skinned pride, were for her hope enough: a welcome knocking at the door, a veil drawn aside.Noel Rowe.Colin Laverty By Carol (Laverty) HarrisFRIDAY(For my Dad: Colin Laverty)We always ate fish on Friday.. And Dad bought lollies that he would hide.Family ritual;Catholic custom.Keeping verandah vigil, peering between laticed windows.He’d run outsidewhen we saw him coming.Every week a new locationWe would crawl and pry in pocketsAnd search for the elusivepacket of treasures.li Lask was sweet but the game was better.Carol (Laverty) HarrisI remember we would go to the dances. Either by horse, or sulky. Many a waltz competition was entered and won. Most were musical and would play in the band: piano; drums; violin; spoons; mouth organ and gum leaf. The children would be taken along and when they went to sleep would be bedded down on dried corn husks on the stage.In those time we all had chores to do. The worst was to go for the cows on cold frosty mornings. With little clothing to keep the body warm and no shoes on the feet we would hunt the cows up to stand in their beds and even stand in the fresh cow cakes for warmth!. Noreen Laverty Fuller.My Mother (Sarah) taught Catechism for many years at the Taylors Arm Church. She also was sacristran and Church organist for some time. She instructed people in the Catholic faith, taught the boys the Latin and how to serve an the altar.Clem, Gen, Norah (Kirkman) Len and John all helped in takingcare of the Church. Clem and Len taught Catechism for manyyears as well. We had a nice choir. The main singers were Len and John. I was always proud to be related to the Laverty family, my mother being one. I can remember as a small child, they always prayed the Rosary.Nora Mulveena.Nora Laverty was my Grandmother. We loved her very much. She was a very special lady, so kind and gentle to all who knew her. She always gave the priest lunch after Mass and everyone loved her who knew her. To the Tobins she was like a doll with her pretty hats and dresses. What a great world if there were more like our mother and Brandmother.Wyn Sayer.EARLY DAYS By Angela (Laverty) KruzbergerFor my Mum and Dad, Lilly and John Laverty. Things were very hard, with not much money and very littleprofit to be made from working on the farm. I remember a sow gave birth to her piglets in a deep water hole and all were drowned. The hares came and ate all the seed after it was planted forthe cattle. The dingoes used to attack the cattle. Dad weentbut armed with a gun, cartridges and a screw driver. Thescrewdriver was used to remove spent cartridges. The day he shot one large dingo but not before he and his tate had killed two cows and two more had to be destroyed. Four others were found injured, and three of them died later. So out of the whole lot only one was left alive. That one was sold for #4/2/6..which was the earnings for fourmonths hard work. The weekly meat order was one pig’s head and a shin bone which was made into brawn or soup..Try doing this in 1989. Like many others they managed to raise a large family of ten with very little money, but lots of love for us all to share. And I know that we would not change our Mum and Dad.Angela (Laverty) Kruzberger.“Dear Carol, I recieved this in the post today, so thought I would send on to you, as Heather would like it to go in the book. Hope you are sorting it out without too much trouble. “I remember the times: Heather Smith (Kirkman) Evan was a great one for a cuppa. No matter who called they were always invited in for a cup of tea or two. He would say “The kettle is just about boiled”. Poor Lizzy would be expected to find some wood (There was never any in the woodheap), make the fire, and boil the water for tea.Evan meanwhile would be rolling another cigarette andcatching up on the news. The tea would arrive about half an hour later.There was this old Irishman we were all scared of. He rode a big grey horse and always smoked 0.P’s tobacco. Well, whenever he approached the girls had this code. Some would start singing “Abe, Abe, Abe my boy”. That was our cue to disappear and leave Lizzy to answer the knock or call. It took her a long time to work out why no-one else was ever about when he called. Poor old Lizzy got caught every time. The same gentleman went to mass at Taylors Arm and would put #1.00.00 on the plate. After Mass he would go and ask Father Colhan for some change. This is a true story.” Love Noreen“Remember the time” By Margaret (Laverty) SharpeWhen any of our family get together all we do is “remember the time…”. So even though it might not seem funny to anyone who hasn’t been there and done that we could always find plenty to laugh at. Remember the time Mum was in Kempsey Hospital and dad.decided he would make our Christmas pudding. He sent us kidsout to find as many raspberries and goosberries as we couldand he mixed this thing he called a pudding, tied it in abag, and cooked it in a kerosine tin. Well, it baked andbaked, and when he went to take it out it was jammed hard in the tin. She was a beauty. I can’t remember if it tasted O.K. but with some of “Heather’s” custard I reckon we would I have had a feast. Dad made us a bed mattress one time out of corn husks. We thought it was great until that night we discovered he had not taken the marbly bit out of the end. It wasn’t real comfortable but what the heck, we loved it just because Dadmade it.Our Mum was a wonderful woman. I’ve yet to meet anothermother who would have 19 babies in 20 years and never growl about it, but was overjoyed every time she was to have another “little one” as she would say. On October 1, 1955 our eldest daughter was born,..Evan and Lizzy’s first Grandchild. Evan went all out and celebrated. They tell me he got drunk bought Mum a sewing Machine, a new set of saucepans and a new clothe’s line. Isn’t that just like a man…no flowers and chocolates in mind!My brother, Kevin Laverty (now deceased) together with Peter Casey, John Walton, and Gary Larkey, used to play marbles throughout most of their lunch break. They would then race home for a sandwich and were always late for the bell. I found these definitions and I’m sure Kevin would have enjoyed them:“COMMONOS”..Ordinary marbles used during games and for swaps.“TAKERS”….Marbles given away when the game was lost.“TOR”…….Your favourite shooting marble“BOTTLEDS”..Glass marbles from the neck of soda bottles“CLAY DABS”.White clay marbles.“BONE ALLEYS” Marbles found in the frames of wall maps displayed in local banks. These were commonly “obtained” by children.“AGATES”….Prized, colourful stone marbles. The most precious ward Cornelia which was said by some to be a form of gemstone.“STEEL IES”..Metal marbles that came from the wheel bearings in the front wheels of the Ford.Dorothy (Laverty) Clarke.I guess that every Laverty worth the name remembers the day. that Denny, while working in the bush, was caught in a heavy shower of rain. Being quite a cold day, he sought shelter in a hollow log which was quite warm and comfortable. In fact he became so relaxed that he fell asleep. The rain kept falling, and on awakening some time later Denny discovered that the log had considerably shrunk and he could move neither foreward nor back to get out. Thinking it might be possible that he would NEVER get out, thoughts of his past life floated before him as he tried VAINLY to think of a few worthy deeds or commendable actions he had performed in his lifetime. After a great deal of thought he finally remembered the day he had given a shilling ot the Salvation Army. At this thought he felt so small that he was able to slip out quite easily!His wife’s two cousins from Sydney, in their twenties at the time, were so engrossed by this tale, that after many Oos and Ahas they were almost ready to kill him when he got to the end of the story. Nevertheless, they were always anxious to hear more of Denny’s. talse the bush. Eileen’s favourite story was of the time he was sitting onthe grassy slope or rock playing his violin. Sensing someslight movement behind him he cautiously took a sidewaysglance, saw a snake approaching, kept on playing and….on the last note bought the bow back, let go smartly and killed the snake! It went out on a musical note) Then there was the time when Leo was living in Nowra that he and Denny decided to ride their pushbikes down Cambewarra Mountain, towing behind them some large tree branches to act as brakes. This is an extremely steep mountain and they came hurtling down at about a hundred miles an hour. The trip was not one they were anxious to repeat..Kathleen (Frew) Wormald.We lived three miles from Burrapine hall and my Dad carted cream thirteen miles in a horse and cart. When my brother and I started school we stayed with our grandparents through the week and Dad picked us up to go home for the week-end. We used to drive a horse and buggy to the dances in Burrapine Hall and driving past the trees we always thought the moon was following us. There we slept upon corn husk mattresses in the hall. They were covered with striped material and rattled when you moved. In those days they danced till daylight when the children would be raused and we would go home. I remember well the 1921 flood when we lived on corned beef and home made bread.Kathleen (Frew) Wormald.Michael James LavertyMichael James Laverty, known as “Long Mick”, was born on the nineteenth of August, 1899. He married Ada Daley of Kempsey on 1/7/1925.. He was born at “Riverview”, Taylors Arm. The original house is still standing at theback of the house presently owned by Mr M. Wright at Laverty’s Bridge. On the property in the early years of the 1900’s professional foot running was conducted. The newer part of the house stands on the track. Dad told the tale of the runner who slowed to run second, asked his reason he replied that the first prize wasa violin, one of which he already a new pipe which he could well do oned, but the second was with.Mick was also a very good swimmer. The local races were held in the “Big Hole” almost behind the Taylors Arm Hall The local dances were also held at the barn at“Riverview” in the early days.Also on this property was the blacksmith’s shop on the eastern side of the Taylors Arm Hall. Jack Laverty, Dad’s father, and his Uncle Sam, had some memorable times here with other colourful characters of the area. Usually it was Sam’s job to run the cutter to the Hotel for a “bucket of beer”.Our father never ventured far to claim a bride, she came to Taylors Arm, from Kempsey, to work in the local store. The Irish were certainly loyal. At this time, three Michael Laverty’s lived at Taylors Arm. To save confusion they were referred to as “Long Mick”; “Mick”; and Michael. Dad did a bit of this, that, and anything, being a farmer; butcher and hire car operator amongst other things.However, he managed to rear us during the Great Depression of the 1930’s. He never had any Diplomas for Animal Husbandry however,we can remember his attempt to circumvent a rogue bull he owned. The uoll kept breaking the fences to run with the herd. However, the cows needed to be regulated. His method was to use a corn bag undercarriage with a surcingle over the back to prevent penetration. This falled when he ran out of bags! The whole process proved a disaster andde regulated the entire herd. The old homestead has changed ownership several times since we were there, however, we shall always remember the green, green grass of home”. Written on behalf of the family byRonald. J. Laverty. 21/6/89.VINCENT JOHN LAVERTY. 1901-1974 By NOEL LAVERTYIn his early days he was a keen motor bike rider. Laverty’s Flat in those days was full of corrugations, and to get over these ruts he used to travel at 80 m.p.h. on his Harley Davison, quite a fast speed in those days. His early working days consisted of scrub falling and grass seed picking by hand into tubs.For sport he used to play cricket. Wood chopping was also a favourite sport and he was still doing this at the age of 60.In the Depression years Vin and Ollie had a boarding house in Macksville. Board was 2/- a night per head and 2/6 for a three course meal. Everyday somebody would knock on the backdoor for a free meal because there was no workavailable. After abo ut six years, Vin and Ollie sold out, went back to Taylors Arm and started a butcher shop. He used to kill all his own meats and cure his own bacon. Pigs had to be done in a special way, by using “box” timber logs. Bacon wassmoked over an open fire. Killing beasts for the shop had to be done in late evening during summer because of blow flies and no refrigeration. At dusk the dingoes could smell the blood, and would come to the slaughter house to eat it. One night, the dingoes were so bad they attacked the cattle. Vin had to get the shot gun out to them and shot his own dog by mistake.Vin’s mustering horse was called after an aboriginal bearing the name of “Gunnywildie”. At show time he was entered into several ring events and won on many occasions. After selling the Butcher shop, Vin owned a banana plantation, and finished his working days working the farm with his brother “Long Mick”. Those who knew Vin Laverty, say he didn’t mind a “beer”, or “a fight”.NOEL LAVERTY. On behalf of the family.“BUB” LAVERTY By Bernice (Laverty) AdamsThis is about my Dad. Everyone knew him as “Bub” Laverty. Dad was born and lived a lot of his life in Macksville and Taylors Arm. He came from a big family: five boys; and five girls.Dad could always tell some good yarns about when he was growing up in Macksville. Taking watermelons from the shop and eating them down by the river, collecting bottles by the pub, swimming in the old river baths, fishing and playing football were all part of the stories.I wish he had written some of these incidents down for us. and our children. Dad was a jack of all trades and could do anything for any of his family. He had many qualifications in his life viz: banana grower, butcher, wool classer, the navy duringthe war, and best of all.. a great Dad! He always called Taylors Arm home no matter where we were. Dad had a great love for all his family and was alwaysthere for them.I think that must go with the name “Laverty” as so many are warm and caring people.EARLY HISTORY OF THE LAVERTY FAMILY By Jane E. Laverty. 1988.On July 22, 1841, John and Jane Laverty bid a final farewell to their families and set sail aboard the TRINIDAD from Greenock, Scotland. They were about to begin a new life as assisted free settlers in the colony of New South Wales.Little over a month had passed since the twenty four yearold carpenter, John, had taken the 20 year old housemaidJane Mckaughan, as his bride.They were both native of the village Bushmills in the County of Antrim, Ireland and had been educated to read and write. This would help them pass the time on the TRINIDADand later in the education of their children in isolated rural Australia.Although the TRINIDAD was essentially a supply transport to the colony, 20 crew members, together with 164 emigrants paying one pound each, and carrying with them the specified 16 shirts; &amp;amp; pairs of stockings; 2 pairs of shoes and 2 complete suits of external clothing as men; or 6 shifts; 2 flannel peticoats; 6 pairs of stockings; 2 pairs of shoes and 2 gowns for women, undertook the 15 week, 2 day journey from Greenock to Port Jackson.The trip was relatively trouble free under the mastership of James Brown. With only one death, that of an infant who was buried at sea, John and Jane and the other emmigrants turned Lheir minds to their future. It was rumoured that the land beyond the mountains was beingopened up and that it was rich and fertile. It was here thatthe young couple planned to make their home.Un November 6, 1842, the TRINIDAD dropped anchor at Port Jackson.soon after arrival John Laver by applied for a land grant South West of Sydney. He recieved a grant of 40 acres on the Fluis River adjoining the road from Taralga to the developing township of Binda. At the time it was considered that 40 acres was sufficient for the raising of a family. It had been in the U.K.Jane was by now showing the first signs of pregnancy. Her young lusband took to clearing and building on the new block. of land. They moved into the slab hut and on August 16, 1842, the first daughter, Isabella Ellen Laverty was born.several other hard working celtic families now occupied blocks of land in the area which soon became known as Limerich. Many of them had similar backgrounds to John and June or were Licket-of-leave men. They included the Allport, Berrell, Cartwright, Croker, Mckenzie, McDonald, and Treacy families all of whom have descendants remaining in the Limerick-Laggan area Today.By 1847 Jane had produced 3 more children, Ellen, Mary and Betsy. They did not dream that in 20 years tragedy was to strike with the deaths of Betsy and Ellen within four months of each other.John and Jane’s first son, John, was born in 1850, and was later to marry Mary Croker. In 1851 John and Jane were granted 30 acres for the sum of 30 Pounds. It was here on the Cooksvale Creek that they were to erect the substantial stone house “Hazeldean”. This was to be built in the style of the houses he remembered from Ireland in the 1820”s. It had a shingle roof and a home-made brick oven. The kitchen was separate from the rest of the house as was the tradition.for fire safety. John also built a supply store to service himself and his neighbours. It was built of Baltic Pine from the ballast of sailing ships imported to Australia. The store still stands today and Hazeldean is still owned and occupied by Lavertys. As time passed both John’s land and family expanded. Between the years 1851 and 1862 six more children were born. They were Stuart, who married Kate Ritchie; Rose, who married Shadlow and was a housemaid to Banjo Patterson; James Boyd, who married Christina McDonald; Margaret; Robert, who married Jane Mc Donald, and Charles who married Alice Coupland.John could never have envisaged that 140 years after hefirst undertook the daunting task of clearing his block of scrub, that his descendants would be as avidly engaged in Reafforestation. John’s son Charles was a surveyor and mapped much of the Limerick district in the 1880’s before leaving the area towork in Bridgetown, Western Australia, and helped in the opening up of that area. The other four sons remained in the Limerick area, farming.Jane Laverty died in 1879 at the age of 59, and John four years later at the age of 66. Although neither lived to be particularly old, few could argue that their lives had been unfulfilled.By the time of John’s death he had seen the birth of eleven children, and four Grandchildren. The descendants of this couple, down to the sixth generation, still occupy and graze the land in the Limerick-Laggan area of N.S.W.Anecdotes by Ian Laverty. Limerick 1989.Researching ones family tree is an interesting and rewarding pastime. Time spent talking with aged relatives can produce gems of information and anecdotes revealing the humour of past generations, and our changing values.I like this one.UNCLE: My Great-Grand Father had five children.NIECE: No uncle, he had eleven. UNCLE: FiveNEICE: No, ElevenUNCLE: Well, the others must have been girls!John Laverty and Jane Mc Kaughan were parents to thechildren listed below:ISABELLA (16/8/1842…19/12/24)ELLEN (16/10/1843..24/10/1867)MARY (8/7/1846….date unknown)BETTY (22/5/1847…2/2/1868)JOHN (8/2/1850….20/4/27)STUART (18/9/1851…25/4/17)ROSE (4/4/1853….date unknown)JAMES (6/1/1856…. 19/4/12)MARGARET (12/9/1857…date unknown)ROBERT (16/8/1859… 11/6/0BXCHARLES (4/2/1862…. 18/12/30)JOHN LAVERTY (1850-1927)John married Mary Croker whose parents had travelled on the TRINIDAD with John’s own parents. Their only child Allan,. served with the 7th light horse in World War 1. Allan died on 29 February, 1917, shortly after his return to Limerick. After Allan’s death John moved from “Kangaloolah”, to Goulburn, but. maintained a benevolent interest in his nephews advising them on farming matters. He had been a hard working man and it is said he used his wife’s bathtub in which to dip the sheep. He was also a firm businessman and threatened to pull a house down around some non-paying tennants in Goulburn. He had unharnessed the buggy and hitched the team to the chimney before the payment was forthcoming.STEWART LAVERTY (1851-1917)Stewart married Kate Ritchie. They produced no children, but raised Stewart’s nephew Lance Laverty as their own. They lived at Hazeldean Limerick.Stewart was noted, as were other Laverty’s for his dry wit. He was a non-athletic gentleman who operated his farm and the Limerick store which had been established by his father. Stewart kept boiled lollies in an open jar on the counter, and as he went to the back store rooms for other goods the local children would pilfer them. He never seemed to notice, but he kept tobacco and the like well out of reach. Stewart’s block needed some ring-barking and he being of short, stout stature, often dealt with this task on horseback. Some stumps are still visible, ringbarked seven, or eight feet above the ground. A disturbed possom once frightened the pony which bucked Stewart off. Unperturbed, Stewart remarked before painfully re-mounting “While I’m on the ground I might as well relieve myself!”Like all sheep farmers, Stewart jealously quarded the healthof his sheep. One day when shearing was due to commence LongBlows rode up on his horse with shears prominently displayed on the saddle. “Where are you going, Long?”, Stewart asked “To shear for you” was the reply. “By cripes, you’re not” retarted Stewart “You killed half of them last year. Do you want to kill the rest now?” Stewart had great bitterness of the Germans and Turks and took it with him to the grave. A clause in his will reads that his property is never to fall into the hands of Germans. or Turks or their descendants.JAMES BOYD LAVERTY (1856-1912)James married Christina McDonald and they made their home at Phils River, two miles upstream from their parents original slab hut. They produced nine children.. five sons and four daughters. James was a God fearing man. A regular Church goer, he often. rode the four miles downstream with the Anglican parson on. his way from Binda to the Bolong Church. Not wishing to: waste an afternoon he would take his dog along to inspect. sheep and shepherds on the return journey. On one occassionthe dog disgraced himself in the church. Pastor Heatherington said “I’m glad to see you James, but next month, leave the dog at home!”ROBERT ALEXANDER LAVERTY (1859-1908)Robert married Jane McIntosh and together they had nine.children. Their first home was established at Deep Creek, mile from Hazeldean, but when it failed to rain Deep Creek dried up. Robert then built a second house, this time on a site high above Cooksvale Creek. Again, however, it proved. to be a long way from permanent water. This homestead “Fairview” is still occupied by their descendants. Robert and Jane’s grandson became the second Allan Laverty: to lose his life due to war service. Allan, son of Adeline and Oswald Laverty, died when an unmarked Japanese prisoner of war ship was torpedoed by the Americans off the coast of the Phillipines on 12, April 1944. He was aged 28 years. Another Grandson, Leo McDonald was awarded the Military Medal for Bravery on the Kokoda Trail in 1942.CHARLES LAVERTY (1862-1930)Charles married Alice Coupland and they had three children. Charles was the only son of John and Jane to take up an occupation other than farming. He gained his surveyors ticket and surveyed land around Goulburn before moving to Western Australia when that state was being open up in the late 1880”s. They travelled by coach to Adelaide then sailing ship to Fremantle. Their infant son Lance was too frail and young to make the long journey. He remained in the care of his Ubcle Stewart and Aunt Kate.Lance was later to own, in partnership with Charlie Hall, one of the first motor garages in Crookwell. In his declilning years he worked for Weekly’s Stock and Station Agency in Crookwell. Lance married but left no children. Charle’s daughters both lived in Western Australia. Charles is buried in Bridgetown Cemetery, Western Australia.Laverty’s of Limerick By Jane LavertyThe information for the Laverty”s of Limerick has been primarily collected and supplied by Jane Laverty who is at present studying Biomedical Science at the University of Technology in Sydney. The two poems here printed are written by her.A SPECIAL PLACE.Above the gold acaciaAnd sparkling rivers deep. Where Lowries spread their glorious wing.

It has taken me some time to contact various relatives and get their replies. I am very grateful to Mrs Jean England of Bordertown S.A. who sent me the Algie family book. Also Mrs Betty Dart of Nhill and Nell and Max Etherton of Rainbow. We only know that Henry Laverty came fromIreland, but nothing about his family. Henry and Jean (Algie) came overland from Edithburgh with a bullock wagon and took land at Yanac, which is 38 km north-west of Nhill. They had five daugnters and two sons. I cannot find any information about the daughter Alice. Several of the children were married at Yanac or Broughton. Both Henry and Jean are buried at Dahwedarre cemetery Yanacalso their son James and his wife Maude… I have sent photocopies of your information to some of the relatives as although there are many descendants of Henry and Jean, only my Father-in-law, Husband, and brother-in-law (and our children) now bear the family name. Also there is Robert Laverty of Coberg. He has no children. Hope this information is of some use to youYours sincerely Margaret Laverty.Henry Laverty was born on Janurary 12, 1840 in Ireland. He married Jean Algie, in the Clare district some time before 1970. Jean was born at Pollockshaws, Scotland on March 14, 1846. They must have moved to Edithburg- probably onto the Algie farm as his name appears in a Rechobite Register as a member in Edithberg. Some time after 1876 they moved to Victoria where they took up a farm at Yanac near Nhill, and there lived the rest of their lives. Many descendants of the Laverty family still farm or live in the Nhill district.

There were four issue from the marriage.Catherine’s Cemetery headstoneSurname Origin Most hereditary surnames in Ireland only came into use in the tenth century by command of the illustrious King Brian Boru. Historians believe Irish pedigrees are fairly accurate back to the 6th and possibly to the 5th century. The Dornan surname is the anglicized form of the Gaelic surname Ó Dornáin or Ó Doirnín where the Ó indicated the ancient Irish name origin and descent from the three sons of Milesius who had issue. According to O’Cleary who in 1632 compiled The Annals of The Four Masters in ancient days the Ó was reserved for the Milesian Irish families of high or noble rank.County Down - Ireland When Charles and Catherine Dornan arrived from Ireland in New South Wales in Australia in August 1841 their immigration records had the age of Charles as 22 (so born ca. 1819), and Catherine as 20 (so born ca. 1821), and Alexander as 11 months (so born Sept 1840). The names of Charles’ parents were given as Alexander Dornan and Anne and Catherine’s as Michael Laverty and Anne. Their birth places were given as Ballanahinch, County Down and the occupation of Charles as farm servant and Catherine as house servant and it was stated Charles could read and write and Catherine neither 5. The town of Ballynahinch (sic) is located in Magheradrool Parish in County Down about 15 miles south of Belfast. According to the Knox History of County Down it had a population in 1841 of 911 when it is presumed the Dornan’s left for Greenock in Scotland to join the ship for the voyage to Australia. Their New South Wales immigration arrival record had the religious denomination of Charles and Catherine as protestant. Their ca. 1839 marriage likely took place in the Church of Ireland which would have been the denomination in which Charles was baptised. As the immigration records of Catherine’s later arriving in NSW brothers Denis and Michael Laverty had their denomination as Roman Catholic it follows Catherine would have been baptised at one of the Roman Catholic chapels in the area, the most likely being the R. C. chapel south of Ballynahinch in Magherahamlet parish, and when marrying as the saying went she ‘turned her coat’. As is the case with the surviving Church of Ireland and Presbyterian baptism and marriage records for the area, except those for the 3rd Ballynahinch Presbyterian, the baptism records of the Ballynahinch, Magherahamlet, and Dromara R.C. chapels all start too late for her baptism record. C of I marriage records for Magheradrool parish start from 1845 which is also too late for the ca. 1839 marriage record. The Tithe Applotment valuations of farm tenements for County Down date from 1827 to 1834. They listed several with the Dornan surname but none had the given name of Charles Dornan’s father Alexander and there were none with the Laverty (Lougherty) surname. From records of Catherine’s brother Michael Laverty it is known the surname of Catherine’s mother was Boyd which was a name noted occurring in the applotment valuations in several parishes in County Down with the most common given names being John and several Samuel’s - both given names bestowed by Michael and Ann Laverty on their children. In the NSW immigration arrival record Rev. Charles Boyd, vicar of the Ballynahinch Church of Ireland, certified as to the baptism register entry for Charles suggesting that was where he was baptised. Rev. William Mortimer a Church of Ireland curate at Magherahamlet Church of Ireland where Charles’s Boyd’s brother H. E. Boyd was the vicar certified as to Catherine’s baptism entry. The absence in the tithe applotment valuations of the names of the fathers of both Charles and Catherine suggest by 1827 they were town dwellers or worked on farms tenanted or owned by others. In the case of Catherine’s father such is also suggested by the 1861 census of Co. Cumberland in England where the occupation of her father Michael was given as - ‘formerly agricultural labourer’ 6. In 1853 when Catherine’s ca. 1825 born brother Denis Laverty arrived in Sydney his immigration record gave Belfast as the abode of his parents Michael Laverty and Ann Boyd. By the time of the 1861 census of England, with their three younger sons ca. 1826 born Michael Jr., ca. 1833 born Samuel and ca. 1835 born John, they had relocated 160 kilometres across the Irish Sea to Cleator Moor near Whitehaven in the County of Cumberland (since 1974 located in the County of Cumbria) where they resided until their deaths. At the 1861 census the household included a grandson Michael born ca. 1846 indicating there was likely at least one other son of an unknown given name who had married ca. 1845 or earlier and was either deceased, had remained behind in Ireland, or in 1861 was living elsewhere in England or for some other reason was not listed. The after arrival history of Catherine’s brother Denis Laverty who arrived in Sydney in Sep. 1853 on the Telegraph is unknown. The Immigration Deposit Journal for 1864 have that Catherine’s husband Augustus Raymond in March deposited £18 towards the fares of her brother Michael Laverty (30), his wife Sarah (28), and two children Dennis (5) and Catherine (2) who subsequently arrived in Jan 1865 on the St. Hilda and settled on the mid-north coast of NSW at Taylors Arm where three more children were born and he died in 1888 7, 8.Emigration &amp;amp; Settlement at Macleay River Charles and Catherine Dornan and infant son Alexander arrived in Sydney in New South Wales with 277 other immigrants on 28 August 1841 as bounty immigrants on the Percy that left Greenock on the Firth of Clyde in Scotland on 21 May 1841. It was not a propitious time to arrive in the then British colony. At Macleay River on the mid-north coast, where it is indicated they settled sometime between arrival in August 1841 and Dec 1842, the 1st March 1841 census recorded the district’s population as 584. It was a peak from which for some years the number declined as the country as a whole experienced its most major depression since first settlement in 1788. The sharp decline in cedar prices caused many employed in its extraction at Macleay River, unable to earn an income adequate to substain themselves and pay the £4 annual licence fee, to leave the area. A letter published in The Sydney Herald of 16 June 1842 stated hundreds of sawyers had left the river in the last few months with others leaving daily for other parts of the colony and the few sawyers who remained and their families presented a miserable appearance. In the absence of official statistics for any of the years in between the 1841 and 1851 census the extent of the decline is indicated by the recollection of an early resident, who arrived at the river as a 13 year-old in 1839, that when growing up there he knew the name of every white resident on the whole of the Macleay which he said was not a difficult task as there were less than fifty white men 27. Two early 1970s publications contain erroneous accounts of the early history of Charles and Catherine Dornan at Macleay River and in respect of a purported disappearance without trace in 1852 of Charles. Marie H Neal&#39;s 1972 published history of the Macleay, titled Valley of the Macleay, quoted from a 1964 letter to the Macleay Valley Historical Society from a Charles &amp;amp; Catherine 1922 born great granddaughter as follows:-&quot;On the South bank of the river close to Kempsey, also, settlement was increasing. ... To encourage the sale of farming land it was decided to permit the purchase of small farms not exceeding sixty acres. One of the first to take up such a small farm near Kempsey was young Charles Dornan, who, with his nineteen-year-old wife and infant son Alexander, had arrived in Sydney from Ireland in 1841. They were soon established on their small farm at Pola Creek. The clearing of the virgin land and the cultivation of crops had to be done without the aid of convict labour. The timber was felled and burnt, leaving trunks and large branches in the paddocks. The grain was sown among the rubble for some years before ploughing was possible. In 1852, with five daughters added to his family, Charles Dornan decided to try his fortunes on the southern gold fields. He did not return and his family came to believe that he had been murdered for his gold. Catherine Dornan and twelve-year-old Alexander were left to carry on the family farm and support the large family, now increased by the birth of a second son, Charles, three months after his father&#39;s disappearance. In the years to come the Dornan farm at Pola Creek became a showplace on the river and a fine tribute to the tenacity and diligence of its pioneer owners.&quot; 9.another great grandchild similarly stated in a 1970 published booklet on Dornan familyhistory that the Dornans’ first settled on a farm at Pola Creek in 1841 etc. as folows:-“It was only fifty three years after the first settlement at Sydney Cove that the first Dornans arrived and took up a land holding at Pola Creek. … Charles Dornan had been a farmer in Northern Ireland and had little interest in town life or in the rapidly expanding city of Sydney. Learning that land grants were being made available in the new district of Macleay River, he applied for and received a land grant on river flats, three miles east of the small town of Kempsey. In either November or December 1841 Charles and Catherine Anne Dornan sailed from Sydney and arrived a few days later to take up their land grant at Pola Creek” …the same account had that after the discovery of payable gold in Australia in 1851 Charles went prospecting in 1852 and disappeared without trace:-“Leaving his wife and six children at Pola Creek he set out for the goldfields. His second son, Charles, was not born until three months later … He was away from home for some months. His last letter told of how successful he had been and that he had decided to return to Pola Creek. Charles Dornan was never heard of or seen again.” 10Errors in the above accounts It appears the claim that Catherine had a second given name of Anne was an assumption based on the first child born in NSW being named Ann. However there is no evidence Catherine had Ann, or Anne, as a second given name. In Ireland traditionally there was very strong naming pattern for the eldest children with the first born son being named after the father’s father and first born daughter after the mother’s mother. First born daughter Ann’s name obviously came from Catherine’s mother’s given of Ann just as first born son Alexander’s from that of the father’s father. If Catherine had a second given name it would be expected to have appeared in the 1841 immigration record and, in the baptism record of at least one of her first seven children and in at least one of the birth registrations of the last four, and it would have appeared on her Frederickton Cemetery headstone and in the church parish and offical registration record for her 1856 marriage to Augustus Raymond. Whilst the circumstances of the death of Charles Dornan are unknown today he did not as claimed in the quoted accounts just disappear without trace in 1852 when away in the south prospecting for gold or on his way back from there to Macleay River. One can only speculate as to why the fact of his death in Victoria in December that year was not known to the two 1922 and 1910 born grandchildren of eldest son Alexander (1840-1918) who respectively in 1964 and 1970 penned the above quoted accounts that stated he just disappeared without trace when away prospecting for gold. In that regard it should be said that the latter account seemingly just repeated the claims in the 1964 account. The baptism record of Catherine’s youngest child Charles Jr., confirmed by her remarriage less than four years later to Augustus Raymond with her status recorded as widow, establish beyond any doubt that within two months of Charles’s 1852 death it was known to Catherine he was deceased and presumably to her landlord and the neighbours on the John Verge owned “Austral Eden” property where the family were recorded as still residing on 10 July 1852 when the last born daughter Eliza was baptised and to others in the small Macleay River distict that then had a population of about 400 (at the March 1851 census the population of the McLeay (sic) Police District was 391 including 123 for the then private town of Kempsey that later became East Kempsey). That he was deceased was known to the visiting from Port Macquarie St. Thomas Anglican parish minister Rev. Thomas O’Reilly who baptised the four last born children. That church’s parish baptism register entry for the baptism on 6th Feb 1853 at Macleay River of 9 Dec 1852 last born and second son Charles Jr. stated his father Charles was “deceased”. Thus before the baptism Catherine had been either officially notified of his death and its cause, or after an unexpectedly prolonged lack of contact from Charles whose return had been expected, it was ascertained by inquiry of the police. The knowledge of his death would surely have been imparted by Catherine to her then 12 year-old eldest child Alexander who had to assume his father’s place. The question that will remain forever unanswered is why during his lifetime was Charles’s first born son Alexander seemingly reticient in telling his own children and grandchildren his father died in 1852 leaving subsequent generations to believe he had disappeared without trace and presumably had died? It is said in his old age Alexander recounted that the difficult years that followed his father’s “disappearance” were ones of worry and despair and grindingly hard work on the property they had occupied and how he had loved and respected his mother for her courage 10. One can only imagine, with seven young children of whom the eldest was just 12 years old and the youngest only a few weeks old, the despair that Catherine must have experienced on learning of the death of Charles. Disregarding the possibility that when Charles died he was engaged in some form of nefarious activity in respect of which recounting same to his own children would cause them shame, one can only presume Alexander did not speak to his own children of his father’s death as a known fact because at the time being only twelve he considered his father should not have left the family to go off prospecting being in his eyes tantamount to desertion. Given 12 Dec 1852 born Charles Jr. had an average gestation period of nine months the latest his father could have left to go prospecting would have been in early March 1852. Obviously the claim in the 1970 published family history that Charles Jr. was born three months after his father went prospecting cannot be correct as it would mean Jr. was born at the latest in June 1852 six months before his actual birth date recorded in the church parish baptism register. If the claim in the first quoted 1964 written account that he “disappeared” three months before Charles Jr. was born is taken to have been when the last letter advising of his prospecting success and decision to return to the Macleay was written it follows it was written in early Sept. 1852 about three months before he died in Victoria. As a successful prospector it would be expected a return journey to the river would have been by coaster to Sydney and thence by same to Macleay River which at the most would have been expected to take more than three weeks. If Catherine was not officially notified of his death with no further communication from her husband and a non-arrival months later such would have given rise to an inquiry of the Victorian police that ascertained his fate. Also contradictory to the claim in the quoted accounts Charles just disappeared in 1852 and was never heard of again is that such overlooked that less than four years later in June 1856 Catherine could not have legally married Augustus Raymond as under the law her marriage would have been been bigamous and known to be so to her fellow settlers in the small Macleay River community and the visiting clergyman who married them and to the police stationed there. Until a Divorce Act was passed in 1873 marriage in the colony of NSW was for life unless the person marrying was a widow or widower, could prove desertion for not less than seven years, or the person’s spouse had been absent overseas for at least seven years. In the case of a person who simply disappeared and might well turn up again seven years had to first elapse before their spouse could remarry or the spouse would committ the crime of bigamy which was classed as a crime against the moral order of society. In 1856 it was a felony that if proven was punishable by penal servitude. For example in 1864 in the colony of Tasmania the criminal law provided that a husband or wife marrying for a second time could do so only if the spouse - shall have been continually absent from such person for the space of seven years then last past, and shall not have been known by such person to be living within that time. In 1864 upon a conviction for bigamy committed in that colony the person was liable for imprisonment for up to seven years and no doubt a similar term would have applied in 1856 in the colony of NSW. The Victorian BDM registry has the death of Charles indexed under the number 28740 and the name Charles Dorman (sic). Originally recorded in the burial register of St. Peter’s Anglican Church, the oldest Anglican church still standing on its original site in the inner city of Melbourne, the record gave his age as 33 years (i.e. born 1819), date of death as Sunday 12 Dec 1852 and date of burial as 14th Dec 1852 7. He would have been buried in Melbourne’s first burial ground now Flagstaff Gardens that was known to the early Melbourne settlers as Burial Hill. The record gave him as being of Melbourne. The Public Records Office of Victoria (PROV) online index of deposition files for inquests into deaths from 1840 has no entry for an inquest into the death of a Charles Dorman or Dornan suggesting the death was known to be from a natural cause and such occured in the infirmary or was certified to as such by a medical practitioner. No cause of death was recorded in the church register. A search of the then main daily Melbourne newspaper The Argus through to 24 Dec 1852 failed to find a mention of him by name but there was mention of out of town murders of unnamed persons as occurring a day either side of Sunday 12th. If he say had died in a hospital from severe dysentry resulting from food poisioning from a known source likely no inquest would have been required. Accounting for the variant surname spelling as Dorman and not Dornan is that his name may have been spelt phonetically or ascertained as such from a handwritten Miner’s Right he carried with an “N” in the right viewed as an “M” 11.Occupation of Charles Dornan The above quoted accounts are in most respects best described as family folklore having incorrect assumptions presented as facts. They are astray not only in respect of the claimed disappearance of Charles Dornan in 1852 when away prospecting for gold but also as detailed below in respect of him shortly after arrival in Sydney in 1841 having purchased from the Crown a small farm at Pola Creek which was manifestly not the case. It is quite possible Charles and Catherine arrived at Macleay River very shortly after their arrival in Sydney in August 1841. The 7 July 1844 baptism at Macleay River of their 1 Dec 1842 first born Australian child Ann establishes they were there before Dec 1942 12. Ann’s 1860 marriage record did not have her birth place. However the official birth record of her 1861 born first child Agnes had her mother’s birth place as McLeay River. If correct it means the Dornan family arrived at the river before Ann’s Dec 1842 birth. As they arrived there in late 1841 or in 1842 when most residents there were itinerant cedar cutters who moved on they were among the very first white settlers. The published accounts of the family history quoted herein that claim Charles came to Macleay River to take up a small farm at Pola Creek he purchased in Sydney from the Crown within weeks of arrival from Ireland in 1841 are not correct. Daughter Ann’s July 1844 baptism register entry had the occupation of Charles Dornan as a “labourer”. If in 1844 he had been a tenant farmer or a farmer on his own land as claimed it would not have been so recorded. Thus this record alone establishes he did not come to the river as claimed as a land owner but likely came to work for someone there as a farm labourer which was the normal expectation for a bounty immigrant from Ireland whose immigration record on arrival recorded his occupation as a “farm labourer”. The after arrival in Sydney small farm purchase claim was also incorrect because at no time in the decade of the 1840s did the government of the colony make available for purchase any small farms at Macleay River. It was not until 1850 that the Crown sold the first small farm there ! 13 Thus the actual Charles Dornan employment history at Macleay River from his arrival there to his death can only be speculated upon. As cedar extraction was the main commercial enterprise at Macleay River for many years it is possible after arrival in Sydney in August 1841 he was recruited there shortly off the boat and initially came to the Maclay River as a cedar cutter. Alternatively and thought much more likely is that he was recruited in Sydney as a farm labourer by an agent for a Lower Macleay landowner who prefered to employ newly arrived married immigrant farm workers for fencing, livestock husbandry, and tillage and growing of crops etc. to that of the locally available hard living and drinking and usually single cedar sawyers. Indications are he may have found work with Lower Macleay River landowner John Verge who in 1839 began to develop his four square mile (2560 acre) grant that had a six mile (10 kilometer) Macleay River frontage named Austral Eden. It was not until until July 1855 that Verge ran a series of advertisements in a Sydney newspaper advertising the availability of 3 or 4 year free of rent clearing leases of from 10 acres upwards on his “Austral Eden” grant. However earlier he likely made some clearing leases available there of which perhaps Charles may have become the tenant of one before leaving to go prospecting for gold in 1852. Suggestive John Verge must have granted some clearing leases on land he owned at the river before his July 1855 advertisments is that, in respect of leasing land to tenants in Yarravel parish on a land portion he purchased at auction in 1850, a notice in the Government Gazette dated 2 Feb 1855 advising of the resumption of a 7 acre strip for part of the road from Kempsey to Christmas Creek described the strip resumed as having upon it - “a hut belonging to one of Mr. Verge’s tenants” 14. Suggestive in the 1840s Charles Dornan likely worked for John Verge and, perhaps late in that decade may have had a clearing lease on his Austral Eden 2560 acre grant, that after it was subdivided into 67 farm lots was offered at auction in Kempsey on 23 March 1918 with all but one lot selling at the auction, is that on 23 Sep 1849 when daughters Mary Lavender and Catherine were baptised and again on 10 July 1852 when daughter Eliza was baptised the Port Macquarie St Thomas parish baptism register recorded their parent’s abode as Austral Eden and the occupation of Charles ambiguously as “settler”. However he may have then still been a farm labourer as if by 1849 he had been a tenant on Austral Eden seemingly Thomas O’Reilly the curate at St Thomas’ at Port Macquarie would have recorded him as a “farmer” or “agriculturalist” and not just as a settler? In his baptism register entries O’Reilly rarely recorded the father’s occupation as a labourer with his most common description being “settler” with on occassions farmer, grazier, or agriculturalist. After his December 1852 death the occupation of Charles was recorded as “farmer” in the baptism register when son Charles Jr. was baptised in Feb. 1853. That “farmer” was recorded as his occupation suggests in the 1852 year of his death he likely held a clearing lease on the property. Also suggesting in 1852 he likely leased a small farming area on Austral Eden is that seemingly he would not have left his family to join the gold rushes unless there was in place secure accommodation for them and an ability for the family to sustain itself during the period of his intended absence. However that said in respect of his occupation from time to time the only certainty is that in July 1844 Charles Dornan did not lease or own a farm at Macleay River and was employed by someone at the river as a labourer and in 1852 when he went off prospecting for gold the family was residing on the John Verge owned “Austral Eden” property. In respect of recollections of Charles and Catherine’s eldest son Alexander of the family’s early days at Macleay River, Allan King a grandson of Alexander wrote in 1970 that his grandfather had often spoken of their fear and uneasiness of the aboriginals of the area and had told of how groups could arrive and stay camped near a residence fishing the river for weeks before moving on and that at night it had been particulary worrying to see their camp fires so near and figures continually flitting and moving in the shadows. He wrote that on many occassions his grandfather had told that with his parents he watched their camp fires at night whilst the younger children slept 10.Pola Creek Farm Destined in future years to become the nucleus of one of the most prosperous dairy farms at Macleay River the first Dornan family owned land holding was at Pola Creek. However it was not purchased from the crown by Charles Dornan in 1841, as asserted in the quoted accounts of descendants, but purchased twenty months after his 1852 death by his widow Catherine for £102/8/- at an auction of crown lands held at the Port Macquarie Crown Lands Office on 25 Sep 1854. That Catherine with seven young children, whose husband when employed as a farm labourer likely would have earnt about £20 per annum plus rations for his family, was in the position so soon after his death to purchase the farm portion and, then finance the cost of clearing and fencing and constructing a dwelling on it etc., suggests the family legend that Charles was successfull in his gold prospecting had substance and before or after his Dec. 1852 death she likely received monies from that source to enable her to purchase the farm. Of 36 acres (14.5 hectares) the farm portion was situated in the then unnamed Parish of Kempsey in the County of Macquarie designated on the parish map as portion 11 and bearing Catherine’s name as original grantee. It was situated on the south side of the river fronting Pola Creek at its entry to the river - today located 4¼ kilometers down the river from the cross river Kempsey traffic bridge and 1½ kilometres up river from where the 2013 commissioned 3.2 kilometer long Pacific Highway by-pass of Kempsey bridge crosses the Macleay River just north of the small town of Frederickton 15. After remarrying Augustus Raymond in 1856 Catherine continued to reside on the Pola Creek farm until her ten years later death. The Pola Creek farm portion was the first of ten adjoining creek and river frontage portions offered for sale by the crown that day in Sept 1854 and by purchasing it Catherine became the first purchaser of a small farm at Pola Creek. Prior to then no small farms had been sold by the crown on the southern side of the Macleay River. The only crown land alienated at Pola Creek prior to her purchase was a 1296 acre grant to Captain E. L. Adams he named “Hampden Hall” from which the current day Kempsey locality derived its same name. With an over one mile frontage to the Macleay River the Adams grant covered most of the headwaters of Pola Creek and adjoined Enock Rudder’s private village of Kempsey subdivision (that later became East Kempsey) in which the first 35 lots were offered for public auction in Sydney on 26 Nov 1836. Following the 1839 death of Capt. Adams “Hampden Hall” was vested in his trustee A. B. Spark whose name appears on his portions on the parish maps and it was offered for sale in July 1841 as an unsubdivided property said to be suitable for dairying or tobacco growing. By purchasing the 36 acres at the auction Catherine not only became the first purchaser from the crown of a small farm on the south side (East Kempsey / Hampden Hall side) of the Macleay River but also the first woman to purchase a small farm (then termed a country lot) from the crown anywhere at the river and the fourth of a small farm sold by the crown after it first began to sell small farms at Macleay River in 1850. The only small farm purchasers preceeding her were William Smith, after whom the main street of Kempsey was named, and John Verge in 1850 and W. H. Kemp in 1852 of portions ranging in size from 109 acres to 266 acres in the parish of Yarravel on the north side of the river. At the time of her purchase a government town had not yet been proclaimed at Macleay River and no town lots had been sold there by the crown. Assuming Ann Chapman’s pre-emptive purchase of 1320 acres, adjoining her husband’s 170 acre 1857 private township subdivision he named Frederickton, was not made until near the expiry of the 14-year lease, and unless one or more women (unlikely) had purchased a lot in the Enock Rudder private township subdivision that became East Kempsey after the first lots in it were offered for sale in 1836, then Catherine’s 1854 Pola Creek purchase would have made her, excluding a possible but unlikely purchase in the Rudder subdivision, the first woman to purchase either crown land or land previously alienated from the crown anywhere at Macleay River. Nine river frontage portions to the north of Catherine’s portion 11 numbered from 12 to 20 were also offered by the crown at the same auction at which she purchased the 36 acres and were purchased by those whose names appear as original grantee on the above linked to Kempsey parish map - viz. north from Catherine’s portion 11 being in order:- William Henry Lancaster, Bernard Gogerty, Thomas Rowe (2), The Rt. Rev. William Tyrrell D. D. Lord Bishop of Newcastle, Christopher Lawson (2), William Rothery, and John Verge. The availability for collection from the Registry of the title deed for Catherine’s 36 acres was advertised in the Government Gazette early in January 1856 at page 34 and again a few months later at page 1160. After Augustus’ death in 1877 the 1879 Government Gazette at page 3930 carried a notification an intermediate deed was ready for portion 11 for which a £1 fee was payable. Three weeks after the 2 June 1856 marriage of Catherine to Augustus Raymond portion 25 of 57 acres (23.1 hectares) situated on the south side of portion 11 and separated from it by a road reserve was purchased on 25 June 1856 in 15 year-old son Alexander’s name at a crown land auction held upriver at Belgrave increasing the Pola Creek farm size to 93 acres (37.6 hectares) 15. At that auction the remaining three portions fronting Pola Creek to the south of portion 25, being portions 26 to 28, and four portions fronting the river, being 29, 33, 34 &amp;amp; 35, were also offered and purchased by those whose names appear on the parish of Kempsey maps - viz. John Hiller, Cobham Watson, Alexander Cochrane, Campbell Ker (3) and Amelia Paine. As shown on the above linked to parish map the sale of these 8 lots and the prior sale of 10 lots in 1854 making a total of 18 lots comprised all the crown land between “Hampden Hall” and the John Verge “Austral Eden” grant fronting the river and Pola Creek not alienated back in the 1830s by the six mile river frontage 2560 acre “Austral Eden” grant on the north and the 1296 acre “Hampden Hall” on the south.Catherine’s Second Marriage The June 1856 second marriage of widow Catherine Dornan née Laverty to London born widower Augustus Raymond (1821-1877), who arrived in South Australia in June 1849 with his first wife Sarah Terrey Sumerfield (1824-1850), took place at the Pola Creek farm she purchased in Sept. 1854. It was performed by Edward Holland the minister of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church at Port Macquarie where he was the third minister having succeeded William McKee and the first minister William Purves who in 1844 baptised Catherine’s two first born daughters Ann and Jane 16. From her marriage to Augustus Raymond Catherine had four more children whose history and genealogy is given on the Descendants of Augustus Raymond web page. From her first marriage there had been seven children. Her eleven children all married and there were seventy-two known grandchildren of whom only two were born before her sudden death on Easter Sunday 1 April 1866 at the age of 45 years. The 1970 Dornan family history publication stated at the time of the 1856 marriage of Catherine to Augustus Raymond he was a farmer-grazier from the Bellingen River. However that was not the case. There was no Raymond at that river until the late 1880’s when Augustus and Catherine’s 1864 last born son Edward moved there from Bowraville to set up business in the town of Bellingen as a wheelright and coachbuilder. After the passage of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1861, enabling selection beyond the limits of location, land first became available for selection and conditional purchase and was first selected in that district on 4 June 1863. When a great-grandfather of the compiler Walter Harvie arrived there about New Years Day 1863 he wrote that in addition to a shipbuilder and his partner on the lower river the district then comprised only about twenty white men mostly employed by a cedar cutter at Boat Harbour (later named Bellingen), just two white women, and hundreds of aboriginals, and the only domestic livestock was a grey horse. The settlers who followed brought the first cows walking them down the beach from the Macleay so maybe a surplus Dornan bred at Pola creek cow ended up at Bellinger River. The July 1856 Catherine and Augustus marriage record had his then occupation as a carpenter and joiner. It was a skill he would have acquired during a seven-year apprenticeship to his master lighterman father whose Raymond, Mead &amp;amp; Co. Thames River business also built lighters used to transport cargoes to ships. He likely built the house on the Pola Creek farm owned by Catherine in which his eldest son’s obituary stated the family took refuge in its loft from the waters during the 1864 greatest known flood in the history of the Macleay River when a large number of dwellings on the upper and lower river were washed away and many families left destitute. Although by qualification himself a master lighterman in the six years that followed before he emigrated he must have pursued some studies as when Augustus Raymond arrived in Adelaide in June 1849 he gave his occupation as engineer - the same as recorded when he married in London earlier that year. After arrival in South Australia he managed and brought into production that colony’s largest steam-powered sawmill. His first wife Sarah Terrey Sumerfield died on 25 May 1850 at Kensington in South Australia followed five weeks later by a daughter Sarah born five days before her death. By June 1851 Augustus was in Sydney where when giving evidence in a court case he gave his occupation as cabinetmaker. After then all that is known of early occupations in the colony before arriving at Macleay River and marrying Catherine Dornan in June 1856 is that for an unknown period he farmed elsewhere. In March 1859 he purchased at a crown lands auction a twenty-nine acre farm portion at Summer Island on the lower Macleay River on the northern side in Cooroobongatti parish almost opposite Kinchela. However there is no evidence he ever resided there. After the 1856 marriage until 1869, when he and his third wife Margaret Chambers nee Mackay whom he married in Dec 1867 moved to land purchased at Bowra (Bowraville), all records sighted have his address as Pola Creek. Following Catherine’s death Pola Creek was given as his address in notifications in newspapers and in the Government Gazette in 1867 and 1868 in connection with the administration of her intestate estate and in 1869 re the registration of his horse brand.Catherine’s Death As Catherine was a pioneer Lower Macleay settler of about 25 years standing with a large family of 11 children when she died in 1866 the then only Kempsey newspaper The Macleay Herald likely reported on her passing with a follow-up obituary. However whilst it began publication two years before her death no issue earlier than 1878 is known to have survived. At Taree over one hundred kilometres to the south the then weekly published The Manning River News of 7 Apr 1866, pleading a lack of room as the reason it was obliged to that week to condense the report of its Kempsey correspondent, carried only the briefest mention of her passing as follows - ‘‘I must mention that Mrs Raymond died suddenly a few days since, probably from heart disease. She was apparently quite well a few minutes before’’. Catherine is buried in Frederickton Cemetery with the imposing headstone pictured at the top of this article that allowed space on it for the later addition of husband Augustus whose 3rd wife instead of there had him buried in Rookwood Cemeyery in Sydney 4. Beside her are buried her are her first Australian first born child Ann Ball who departed in 1921 and a grand-daughter Fleda May Bradley (the daughter of William Charles Bradley and Catherine Dornan) who in 1897 at the age of twelve years burned to death in her pyjamas 25 .Children of Charles Dornan and Catherine Laverty were: Alexander Dornan Ann Dornan Jane Dornan Mary Lander Dornan Catherine Dornan Eliza Dornan Charles DornanChildren of Catherine Dornan and Augustus Raymond were: Augustus Mead Raymond Sarah Fidelia Raymond Samuel John Raymond Edward James Robert Walter Raymond SECOND GENERATION Alexander Dornan, b.

Two sons went to the First World War of whom the youngest was wounded in France in 1916 and had a leg amputated above the knee, and the other was killed in action in March 1918 near the small French village of Villers Bretennoux. 17.Children of Alexander Dornan and Mary Mackay were: 1. i.

Kempsey, NSW, buried 16 Dec. Frederickton Cemetery ; m. 5 Sep 1860 (#1860-1876) at Frederickton, Macleay River, NSW Edward Ball, b. 1836 Cornwall, England; d. 19 Dec 1877 (#1877-6291), age 41, Macleay River (accidently).Ann Ball née Dornan 19 Ann’s husband Edward died accidently on 19 December 1877 when crushed by a bull he was handling 20. His death registration does not have the name of either parent and instead has his age as 41 years (i.e. born in 1836) provided by the informant. Consistent with the death record age of 41 the birth registration record for his 1861 first born Australian child Agnes, a first person record as the father was the informant, gave his age at 11 October 1861 as 25 years (so also born 1836). That record gave his birth place as Cornwall consistent with the birth place given on his cemetery headstone. The names of his parents were also absent from the official registration record of his 1860 marriage that took place in the School House at Frederickton, as was his age, birthplace, and father’s occupation. His parent’s names are also not available from a marriage entry in the All Saints Parish of Kempsey marriage register as unlike the baptism and burial registers for that parish that date from 1858 the marriage registers before 1885 have not survived. The upshot is that there are no Australian records available that identify his parents 21. His official marriage registration record had Edward’s occupation as farmer. As the marriage was before he selected a 92 acre river frontage portion near Kinchela he was likely a tenant farmer. Parnell was bestowed as a second given name on the 1877 last born child Henry suggesting it may have been the maiden surname of Edward’s mother or otherwise of genealogical significance. As the first born child was named Agnes that name was also likely of prior generation genealogical significance. At the time of this compilation in July 2013, based on his first born child having been named Agnes Jane, a UK web page was speculating Edward’s parents were an Ethan Ball (1808-1880) and Agnes Carne who married in 1826 at St Columb Minor, a village on the north coast of Cornwall in England, and that Edward was their son listed in the IGI as baptised there on 30 Nov 1834 under the surname Baul who was subsequently listed in their household at the June 1841 taken census aged 7 years (so born ca. 1834) and again in the March 1851 taken census aged 15 years (so born ca. 1835). If his parentage has been correctly identified, and there is considerable doubt that it has, it would mean mean the age of Ann’s husband Edward at death was actually 43 and not 41 as given in the cited Australian records 22. Ann proved herself to be a capable business person who during her lifetime built on the initial conditional purchase by her husband after 1862 of a 92 acre Macleay River frontage farm at Longreach in the parish of Arakoon located 2½ miles north of the village Kinchela by selecting and acquiring from others more properties in the area. When Ann died in 1921 the value of her estate was assessed for probate at £20K which was then a substantial estate for a Macleay River landowner. In 1970 Allan King wrote - “The old Ball homestead at Kinchela that stands back about three hundred yards from the roadway … can be seen when driving towards South West Rocks, on the south side of the river 10. Ann’s Sydney newspaper death notice stated she left four sons and two daughters, thirty-four grandchildren, and twelve great-grand-children 19. However from the death records it appears four daughters survived her and, as it was said there four surviving sons, in addition to the three with birth registrations listed below the fourth would seemingly have been a John for whom no birth registration is indexed but whose death was registered in 1932 (#1932-5902) at Ashfield in Sydney with his parent names given as Edward and Ann Ball. If he was their son he should be listed in Ann’s 1921 death registration record and perhaps also named as a beneficary in her probated will.Children of Ann Dornan and Edward Ball were: 1. i.

Jane died of typhoid fever in 1878 at “Greenfields” - a property with a river frontage located three kilometers north of Frederickton that was later owned by the two sons of her step-brother A. M. Raymond. Later that same year her husband John Connors remarried Catherine Agnes Garner (1856-1939) and between 1879 and 1902 had twelve more children. He died by his own hand (asphyxia by drowning) in 1902 at Gladstone and his death registration record had his occupation as saddler 23.Children of Jane Dornan and John Sylvester Connors were: 1. i.

In the parish maps his name appears on portions 13 &amp;amp; 14 comprising 114 acres in the Parish of Ketelghay with a lengthy frontage to Buckra Bendinni Creek. Both he and brother James who married Catherine’s sister Mary Lavender in 1866 were listed in the Grevilles Post Office Directory for 1872 at Buckra Bendinni Creek. The Macleay Argus of 16 Feb 1892 had that the licence of the Turf Club Hotel at Greenhill had been tranfered from Patrick Linegar to William Charles Bradley. An insolvency court schedule filling notice in The Sydney Morning Herald of 8 Nov 1887 had the libabilities of William Bradley (presumed to be his father), a storekeeper of Smithtown, Macleay River as £1992 and assets as £229. The obituary of William Charles appeared in the Nambucca and Bellingen News of 23 Dec 1927. It gave his age as 79, that he was born at Dungog the son of the late William Bradley, and had come to the district when about 19 years of age. It named three daughters and two sons as surviving him - being Mrs G Rowe (Sydney), Mr Charles Bradley (Queenskand), Mrs A McCarthy (Gloucester), Mr Harold Bradley (Inverell), and Mrs R Edwards (Macleay) and said two of his brothers and two sisters also survived him being - Mr Donald Bradley (Sydney), Mr John Bradley (Bowraville), Mrs E. Mitchell and Mrs J Mitchell (Sydney). Of the latter two only the birth of Elizabeth who married James Laing Mitchell in 1880 is NSW birth indexed. The other would be the Jane Bradley who married John Mitchell in 1872 in Sydney.

At that time the family address was given as Macleay River and it was recorded that the occupation of his father Charles had been farmer and he was deceased. As regards the Pola Creek farm, expanded from Catherine’s original 1854 purchase by the purchase of additional portions from the crown and other landowners, in 1970 Allan King wrote - “In about 1875 the property was subdivided for the first time with Charles, the younger brother of Alexander Dornan, taking over the east portion of the land. Charles Dornan built a new homestead on his part of the subdivision and lived there with his family for the rest of his life. … Ern Dornan, a son of Charles Dornan 2nd and grandson of the first Charles Dornan is still living on the property with his son and daughter-in-law and their children. … Three of Charles Dornan’s sons, Gus, Les and Bert, went to the First World War.

Down and their respective ages as 21, 20 &amp;amp; 11 months. The parents of Charles were given as Alexander &amp;amp; Anne Dornan and Catherine’s as Michael &amp;amp; Anne Lougherty (the surname spelling is a phonetic variant of Laverty - both Dornan and Laverty being Irish names respectively anglicised from O Dornain and O Laith Bheartaigh, with the former found mostly in Co. Down in the area adjoining Co. Antrim). The person certifying as to registry of baptism for Charles was the Rev. Charles Boyd vicar of the Ballynahinch C of I, and for Catherine it was Rev. William Mortimer curate of Magherahamlet C of I church where the rector was Rev. H. E. Boyd who was also rector of Dromara C of I and the brother of Rev. Charles Boyd (the reason a C of I vicar and not an R. C. priest certified as to the register of baptism as was stated in the immigrant’s application is not known and can only be speculated upon. It has been suggested Catherine was perhaps her mother’s eldest child and her mother Ann Boyd was either the widow of a protestant Boyd or Catherine was born out of wedlock and baptised as a protestant before her mother married Michael Laverty). The Ballynahinch birth place of both Charles and Catherine could mean they were either born in that town or it was the nearest large town to where they were born. The above arrival record and details are as researched and advised by Carmel Stuart. Note: - the “Digger” CD-ROM titled Bounty Emigration to NSW 1828 to 1842 has the Dornan family surname incorrectly indexed as Doran. In other unrelated Australian family records it has been noted spelt as Doonan, Donan, Dorman.2 The Victorian BDM registry has the death of Charles indexed under the number 28740 and name Charles Dorman (sic). Originally recorded in the burial register of St. Peter’s Anglican Church, the oldest Anglican church still standing on its original site in the inner city of Melbourne, the record has his age as 33 years (i.e. born 1819), date of death as Sunday 12 Dec 1852 and date of burial as 14th Dec 1852. He would have been buried in what is now Flagstaff Gardens - Melbourne’s first burial ground that was known to the early Melbourne settlers as Burial Hill. The record gave him as being of Melbourne. If there an inquest held in 1853 into his 12 Dec 1852 death the depositions file for such would be held by the Public Records Office of Victoria whose Coroner’s Inquest holdings date from 1840. In Sept 2014 these files were not available online and were accessible to researchers by first obtaining the file number from a computer in a reading room and then ordering it online for viewing in the PROV reading room. A digitalisation project was underway to make these records available online through the PROV web site.3 Sydney Morning Herald, 19 Jan 1877, DEATHS - Raymond - January 18, Augustus Raymond, late of Macleay River, in the 55th year of his age.

The edition of Monday 13 Dec. reported that it was said a murder had been committed on Saturday night (11th) at Murder’s Flat, Chokeem Gully with the murderer apprehended by the police. On Tuesday 14 Dec. it reported news had come that morning of a body being found in the neighbourhood of Reedy Creek where the body of a murdered person had been found the previous week.12 In the NSW BDM Indexes her birth indexed under the surname spelling of DORMAN (sic) reference V1842-4567-121 although clearly DORNAN in original - see image at the incorporated link of entry in Register of baptisms, burials and marriages, Presbyterian Church, Port Macquarie (St. Andrews) AONSW microfilm reel #5046.13 Perhaps the claims that after arrival in Sydney in 1841 Charles Dornan purchased the Pola Creek farm from the government arose from an assumption that such were available for purchase based on a letter from a Macleay resident published in a newspaper in February 1841 that claimed in respect of “some of the fertile plains on the banks of the McLeay” that the government’s “Survey Department has likewise caused a considerable tract of country upon the fertile and extensive plains on the banks of the McLeay to be measured out into small farms not exceeding sixty acres ; each for the purpose of being sold, not by auction, but by private contract, agreeably to the plan understood as Lord John Russel’s New Land Regulations, which were recently officially published and which seems to give satisfaction in the northern colony.” The survey in question could only have been that by Clement Hodginson on the north bank of the Macleay River or by James Ralfe on the south side. In April 1840 the Surveyor General of the colony wrote to assistant surveyors Hodgkinson and Ralfe requesting them to respectively survey parishes on the north side of the river (later in County of Dudley) and on south side (Counties of Macquarie and Vernon). In March 1841 Ralfe submitted his survey. The area on the northside of the river was outside the bounds of location and the County of Dudley within which the north side parishes were to be located was not formally created until 1848 and then only with provisonal boundaries. The letter writer was a strong advocate for the crown making available fertile river front land for small farms but his assumption that the 1840-41 surveying meant an availability of same was imminent was well astray and amounted to no more than wishful thinking on his part. In respect of the “Land Regulations” - the northern colony that Lord John Russell the Secretary of State in England for the Colonies proposed was to begin at Manning River and, was to have its own government and legislative council, did not eventuate. In respect of the contracting referred to the regulations provided that crown lands in the proposed third southern colony, that was to extend to Port Phillip and whose northern boundary was to be the Moruya, Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers, could be pre-paid for in England at a set price of £1 per acre by persons wishing to emigrate before they left and upon arrival they could choose an area for their land and then present the land order obliging the government to survey the choosen acreage at its expense. Persons already in Australia could purchase land in the proposed southern colony for the same set price but for the time being the sale of crown land by auction in the proposed northern colony was to continue and in the central third colony centered on Sydney comprising the rest of NSW auction was to remain the method disposal of crown land. The fixed price sale scheme applicable to land in the proposed southern colony was beset with flaws and was abandoned in August 1841 before Lord Russell and the Whig government lost office that year. The first farms (termed Country Lots) offered for sale by Crown at Macleay River were in the parish of Yarravel on the opposite side of the river to Pola Creek. Four portions fronting the river, of which part later became the Central Business District of Kempsey, were offered by the Crown at auction in March 1850. They ranged in size from 109 to 140 acres. Two were purchased by William Smith after whom the main street of Kempsey that runs through the portions took its name of Smith Street and the other two by John Verge. A fifth portion of 266 acres with frontages to both the Macleay River and Christmas Creek, that had been part of the previously held under licence “Glenrock” run, was purchased by John Verge at the same auction. The several portions situated in between were not auctioned by the crown until 1855.14 The Sydney Morning Herald 15 Sep 1842, page 2 had - “As to the expectation of Mr. Verge’s intention to throw open his fine and extensive estate on the banks of the McLeay, with ten miles of water frontage, into small farms, on clearing leases, it is to be regretted that there appears no probability of this gentleman commencing so laudable an undertaking. He has an immense quantity of cedar growing thereon and has been offered a very high price for it, as it stands, but at present appears no way disposed to part with it, or forward it to the Sydney market himself, as was expected. Establishing that when the Dornans’ arrived at Macleay River in 1841 or 1842 John Verge was running sheep on his “Austral Eden” grant is that following the discovery of the stands of cedar at Bellinger River and the influx of cedar there the same newspaper reported on 21 Oct 1842 - “My informant is a person in whose veracity I can place much confidence. He has just arrived from the Bellinger River, where Mr. Verge of the McLeay, has recently removed a flock of sheep, the first person who has yet squatted thereon”. Presumably the sheep were to provide mutton to the cedar cutters who were establishing themselves there after the 1842 reporting of the stands of cedar growing on its banks.15 New South Government Gazette 23 Aug 1854 - as per the The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River Advertiser 30 Aug 1854, page 1. The portion 11 and portion 25 grants were before the introduction of Volume and Folio numbers for land titles and the titles for the two respectively had the dates of 1.10.1855 and 4.12.1856. The later adjacent purchases by Alexander Dornan of portions 67 &amp;amp; 68 had respectively the titles as - Vol. 34, Folio 58 &amp;amp; 67.16 Rev. James Cameron, M.A.. D.D. Centenary history of the Presbyterian Church in New South Wales (1905, Angus &amp;amp; Robertson), p.246 - “This is a very old parish, and dates as far back as the year 1840. In 1841 the church and manse were erected substantially of brick. … The Rev. Wm. Purves was the first minister and came to the district in 1840. He carried on work for about eight years, and was succeeded by the Revs. Wm. McKee and Edward Holland.”17 Allan King, A History Trail : The Story of the MacKay and Dornan Family - a 1970 published booklet of aprox. 50 pages with photos.18 The NSW Birth Index entries for the six Australian born children are as follows:- (1) Ann V1842 4567 121, (2) Jane V1844 4568 121b, (3) Mary Lavender V1846 526 44a, (4) Catherine V1848 537 44a (actually V1848 527 44a immediately following Mary Lavender in the church baptism register), (5) Eliza V1850 663 44A, (6) John (i.e. Charles) V1853 703 44A). NOTE: In 2013 a child named Catherine with parents Charles &amp;amp; Catherine was NSW BDM indexed with the baptism reference of V1849 527 44A. There is no such record and the child did not exist. The entry is a duplication and corruption of Catherine’s 1848 birth year to 1849 with a “10” increase in the record number. Images of the six parish baptism register entries with details of the respective AO reel numbers etc. appear at the link.19 Date of Ann Ball née Dornan’s death - death notice from The Sydney Morning Herald of 19 Dec 1921, and burial details and Ann’s photo provided July 2013 courtesy of Kerry Slack.20 Australian Town and Country Journal 29 Dec 1877, p. 37 - “It is our melancoly duty (says the MACLEAY HERALD) to record the death of Mr. Edward Ball, of Long Reach, occasioned by the attack of a vicious bull. On Tuesday evening last, about 7 o’clock Mr. Ball was attending to the animal, which was tethered, when he became entangled in the chain and fell. The animal turned on him and kelt with all its weight on him. All efforts failed to remove the beast until he was shot. Dr. Gabriel was in attendance on the unfortunate man the same night. It was deemed advisable to remove him to Kempsey, that he might be under the contant care of the doctor. He died on his way up at Frederickton, on Wednesday morning. He leaves a wife and a large young family. The bull had been in Mr. Ball’s charge for two or three years and had never exhibited any vice towards him ; he was nevertheless conscious that that he could not be safely trusted, and warned Mrs. Ball and the children against meddling with him.” Probate of the will of Edward Ball who died on 19 Dec 1877 was granted on 15 May 1878 - his probate packet is held by NSW State Records as: Series 3 #2334 (record series 13660). A 1993 published book on the history of the Nambucca River by historian Norma Townsend titled Valley of the Crooked River mentioned at page 60 in connection with an Edward BALE (sic) having been a selector in the Nambucca-Bowraville district that he was the husband of Ann Dornan. It may have been a typo or spelling error overlooked when the manuscript was proof read, an alias, or a reversion to a real name changed to BALL sometime to prior to his 1860 marriage. In respect of this marriage the book’s author had access to the records at the Kempsey Court House. The conditional purchase records at Land and Property would clarfify as to the surname and the portion number and parish of the selection.21 The officiating minister at the 5 Sep 1860 marriage of Edward Ball to Ann Dornan was Rev. F. R. Kemp (1827-1877), son of in 1839 Upper Macleay settler Major William Kemp, formerly the Anglican minister at Warialda and after at Kempsey the minister at St Thomas’ at Port Macquarie. Bishop Tyrrell of the Diocese of Newcastle purchased land for a church at West Kempsey in 1857 and in 1858 declared Kempsey a parish. Rev. Kemp was sworn in as its first minister on 12 March 1859. The Parish of Kempsey baptism and burial registers dating from 1858 were microfilmed in 1981 by the Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS ) and are publically available for viewing at LDS Family History Centres and at participating public libraries across the ditch in New Zealand and elsewhere in the world other than in Australia. The LDS film of the parish of the Kempsey marriage registers only commence from 1916. However Trove lists the Anglican Church Grafton Centre’s marriage register holdings as commencing from 1885 thus indicating an extra 31 years have become availble since the LDS church filmed the records.22 In 2013 a web page at: http://www.grahamtall.co.uk/family_history/Ball%20Family/migration%202.htm was purporting it was a fact that Edward Ball’s parents were Ethan Ball and Agnes Carne and he was born in St Columb Minor in Cornwall and christened there on 30 Nov 1834 under the surname of Baul making him 43 and not 41 when he died in 1877. However contradictory to the parent names and the place of his birth being a factual is that the Australian records referred to have an 1836 date of birth not 1834. By itself that there was an Edward Ball listed in a household in Cornwall at the 1841 and 1851 census is not enough to identify him with certainty as the age at baptism is contradicted by Australian records and that in the UK census. Also some persons and families were not enumerated at a census and indexers missed people because the name was unreadable or was incorrectly read etc. (e.g. when Findmypast first made available its version of the 1841 UK census it advertised it had 20% more names than Ancestry’s version). Also people born in one county before 1841 could moved to another county by the time of the June 1841 census so be listed elsewhere. As it stands it seems to this compiler there is no proveable basis for the web page author’s Edward Ball parentage claim so the claim they were Eathan and Agnes Ball is speculation presented as fact contradicted by the age of 41 given at death and 25 when Edward’s first child birth was registered in Oct 1861. Whilst the naming of Edward’s first child suggests his mother’s given name was likely Agnes the absence of Eathan in a son’s name makes that less certain. In the absense of confirmation in his children birth registrations that he was actually born in 1834 and not in 1836 it is possible he was the Edward Charles Ball christened on 7 Aug 1836 at Mevagissey in Cornwall whose parents were likely the Edward Ball and Elizabeth Sweet who married in Mevagissey on 9 Feb 1834 or others. It was claimed on the web page a Margaret Agnes Ball died at Kempsey on 12th August 1863. However that claim is not supported by any identifiable record. Official birth and death registration began in NSW in 1856 and there is no indexed death for a Margaret or an Agnes Ball to support the claim. Seemingly it is being said she died intestate but the only Margaret Agnes Ball in the NSW probate indexes is one who died elsewhere 97 years later in 1950 who had probate grants in 1950 and in 1974 and there is no indexed estate administration grant for anyone of that name to support an intestacy. Reference is made on the web page to a Henry Ball. There were several named Henry Ball who died in NSW in the 19th century. There was a Henry Ball who married Elizabeth Salt in the Newcastle/Hexham area in NSW in 1853 who was at the Macleay River in 1872 as the birth of a daughter Laura there is indexed. There was also a James W Ball who married elsewhere in 1864 who also had a child birth registered there in 1867 and a William Ball who had a birth registered there in 1868. It is possible none were related to the Edward Ball who married Ann Dornan. An Edward Ball married in 1860 but he was at Goulburn from then until his death. He became a member of the NSW Parliament and was born in 1827 at Lewisham in Kent and his father Edward was a hairdresser. Not ringing true at all is a story on the same UK web page that William Gaddes and Ann’s husband Edward Ball were life long friends who ran away together from a school at Newcastle-Upon-Tyne after jointly assaulting a school master there in 1846 when both were aged 14 (i.e. that would make Edward Ball as born ca. 1832 and not the record based 1836!) and that thereafter they were shipmates for eight years who after arrival in Victoria ca. 1854 together mined for gold at Sandhurst (Bendigo) in the colony of Victoria where it was said they quote - “accumulated enough wealth to see them through the rest of their lives” so relinquished their claim to the other syndicate members and left to explore the colony. The author of that story Alex Gaddes (1922-1997) is known in other instances to have, starting from a fact, embroided it so remarkably with his assumptions so as to became mostly completely untrue. In this instance the proveable fact was only that his ancestor had been a gold miner in Victoria who experienced a degree of success in his mining there. The claim on the web page, in a quotation from the story about William Gaddes, that the Edward Ball who married Ann Dornan and William Gaddes (1830-1902) were schoolmates very obviously cannot be correct if Edward’s parentage was as claimed as at least until the 1851 census that Edward Ball was still in his parents household in Cornwall so could not have run away to sea with William Gaddes in 1846 and that Edward Ball’s father was a tenant farmer or farm labourer and not a Cornish miner as the story said was the occupation of the father of the “Ned” Ball in the story. According to a Feb. 1830 baptism record and the 1841 census of England seemingly William Gaddes was a twin with Christina Gaddes born in Co. Cumberland (now Co. Cumbria) most likely in 1829 or very early 1830 whose father Richard was a blacksmith who died in that same county in 1862 and was listed there at both the 1851 and 1861 census so highly unlikely he was at any time a blacksmith on other side of England at Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. William Gaddes would thus have been 16 in 1846 and not the 14 given in the story as the age he ran away from home with a “Ned” Ball and joined the crew of a ship at the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne docks and went to sea. It appears the author of the story arrived at an 1846 run-away year by a calculation - first deriving an 1832 birth year from the 1902 death year age 70 on his headstone and then adding to it 14. However whether the run-away year was 1844 or 1846 Gaddes would still not have been in Cornwall at school with the Edward Ball whose father was Ethan Ball and mother Agnes Carne and equally their son Edward could not have been in another place at a school with William Gaddes at any time in the 1840s. The same web page also contained significant errors re the early history at Macleay River of Ann Dornan’s parents etc. of which its author G. Tall was advised by way of drawing his attention to the content of this and another web page. His Ball genealogy web page just rehashed and, years later such remained unaltered despite it being clearly demonstrated to him to be incorrect, the long discredited as erroneous 1972 published claims that Ann’s Dornan’s father Charles had purchased a small farm at Pola Ceek from the crown in 1841 and in 1852 had just disappeared without trace etc. (see footnote #18 above). There is no evidence Ann’s husband Edward Ball was wealthy let alone had enough money to last him a lifetime when he married Ann Dornan in Sept 1860. It was not until after 1862 by way of a conditional purchase from the crown he acquired an uncleared portion of Macleay River river frontage land below Kinchela on terms that would have required of him a £23/10/- deposit with the balance payable over three years that if any remained unpaid bore interest at 5%. Hardly behaviour expected of a man with enough money in about 1856 to last him a lifetime! Before then it seems Edward Ball was likely a tenant farmer who had possibily taken up a clearing lease at Austral Eden or elsewhere at the Macleay made available by a large landowner such as John Verge. It seems probable the author of story about his ancestor William Gaddes, when searching the marriage indexes for an Edward Ball who might fit the “Ned” Ball in the story he composed about his ancestor, noted that there had been a born in Cornwall Edward Ball at Macleay River so adopted him for the Ned in his story who he wrote was a lifetime friend of his ancestor who died in 1902 at Bowraville. He likely did not know Edward had died 25 years before his ancestor so did not fit the Ned who was his ancestors lifetime friend. It appears he was selected for the role simply because of a not to far away geographical proximity to his ancestor who for over 30 years prior to his 1902 death had settled at Bowraville. Maybe the handed down to him legend had only identified his ancestors fellow gold miner and lifetime friend as “Ned”! As regards William Gaddes having become very wealthy from gold mining, depending on how one defines wealth it would be correct in so far as that from alluvial or reef gold mining in Victoria he did acquire what was a condiderable sum then that at least in part he carried with him in a readily negotiable form when he arrived in Sydney from Victoria. It would not be unexpected for him to have had in addition at least an equal amount in the form of a draft on a Victorian bank. An average worker then earned between £50 and £100 per annum. He had 4 or 5 times that amount (£400) with him in the form of gold sovereigns and about 64 ounces in gold dust and nuggets but having left it unattended in his lodgings apparently permanently lost it when robbed of it in early May 1856 after arrival in Sydney when staying in Palmer Street. If he had in addition a draft he could have deposited it with a Sydney bank and with whatever was in his pockets at the time may perhaps still been left with considerable funds at his disposal. As it is indicated in the next year or so he purchased 866 acres at Rollands Plains near Port Macquarie, that maybe would have cost him at least 400 pounds, he must have had some additional funds especially as he later acquired closer to the town an additional 1025 acres 26. However his late 1860’s conditional purchases near Bowraville do not indicate any great wealth and in 1902 when he died it is indicated he was almost broke. There was no will probate or administration grant and the mortgagees had foreclosed on the initial Rollands Plains purchase and earlier on two others near Port Macquarie rural land acquisitions. Within a few weeks of being relieved of the readily realisable assets the story is that he met visiting Mackay ladies in Sydney and moved back with them to Dungog where in July 1856 he is recorded as marrying 16 year-old Jane Mackay, the daughter of Angus &amp;amp; Christina Mackay who arrived in Australia in 1839. After the birth of their first child there on 14 May 1857, that year or the next with other Mackay relatives they moved to Upper Rollands Plains.23 History submitted by poster “pwelsh152” in since discontinued Ancestry.com MUNDIA database.24 The Illinois State Archives death certificate database to 1950 listed two named Charles Crispin - Charles W Crispin who died on 23 Sep 1947 in Waukegan Township and Charles R Crispin who died 27 Aug 1944 in Zion City - both places in Lake County. Whilst the second “W” initial of the former fits, the Zion City place of death of the latter “R” was the headquarters of the Dowietes religious sect who were anti-smoking and believed in divine healing and whose founder and leader Rev.

Bradley, When the River was the Road (1994), p. 70.26 The Sydney Morning Herald, 7 May 1856 - “Five prisoners were discharged from custody, the evidence not making out the charges against them ; among these were the two men apprehended on suspicion of having having stolen 160 soveriegns and gold dust of the value of £240 the property of William Gaddes, lately of Melbourne, on his way to Sydney.” Empire, Wednesday 7 May 1856, “The two men remanded on Saturday on suspicion of having stolen 160 soveriegns and £240 in gold dust and nuggets from a lodging-house in Palmer-street, were discharged, the evidence admitting of suspicion only against one of them.

The deceased gentleman was well-known not only in the Macleay District, but also on the Nambucca and Bellinger. He surcumbed to heart failure following on kidney disease and his death was rather sudden. No one in the vicinity of Stuart’s Point was more highly respected than “Grandfather Cook” as he was affectionately termed both by old and young. A native of Germany the late Mr. Cook was 84 years of age, but he was In all respects except in regard to place of birth an Australian, as he had resided for nearly 60 years in New South Wales, and was intensely proud of his adopted land. Deceased was an earnest member of the Methodist Church, and many years acted as a local preacher, but he was perhaps best known as caretaker of the North Coast Co.’s shed and wharf at Stuart’s Point. He leaves a widow and ten grown-up children to mourn their loss. The sons are Messrs. Frank Cook (Kempsey), Peter Cook (Unkya), L. Cook (Stuart’s Point). Alf. Cook (Taylor’s Arm), Albert Cook (Bellinger River), Fred. Cook (Bellingor River), Phillip Cook (Jerseyville), and Silas Cook (Sydney).

Another theory is that it is based on the traditional Irish folk tune “Carrigdonn” or “Carrigdhoun”.[1] The latter was the same tune used by Thomas Moore (1779–1852) for his song Bendemeer’s Stream.The song is representative of French’s many works concerning the Irish diaspora. The Mourne Mountains of the title are located in County Down in Northern Ireland.The song is a whimsical look at the styles, attitudes and fashions of late nineteenth-century London as seen from the point of view of an emigrant labourer from a village near the Mourne Mountains. It is written as a message to the narrator’s true love at home. The “sweep down to the sea” refrain was inspired by the view of the mountains from Skerries in north County Dublin. It contrasts the artificial attractions of the city with the more natural beauty of his homeland.LyricsOh Mary this London’s a wonderful sightThere’s people here working by day and by nightThey don’t sow potatoes nor barley nor wheatThere’s gangs of them diggin’ for gold in the streetAt least when I asked them that’s what I was toldSo I took me a hand at this digging for goldBut for all that I’ve found there I might as well beWhere the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the seaYou remember old Peter O’Loughlin of courseHe’s here now at the head of the forceI saw him today (while I) was crossing the strandHe stopped the whole line with a wave of his handAnd as we stood talking the days that are goneThe whole population of London looked onBut for all his fine powers he’s wishful like meTo be where the dark Mournes sweep down to the seaThere’s beautiful girls here oh, never you mindWith beautiful shapes nature never designedWith lovely complexions all roses and creamAnd O’Loughlin remarks with regards to the sameOf all these fine flowers you venture to sipThe color might all come away on your lipSo I’ll wait for the wild rose that’s waiting for meWhere the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the seaOh Mary, this London’s a wonderful sight" }, { "title": "Peter Cook Naturalisation Certificate", "url": "/peter-cook-naturalisation-certificate/", "categories": "Laverty Family History", "tags": "Johann Peter Koch", "date": "1878-08-24 00:01:44 +1004", "snippet": "No. 242NEW SOUTH WALES.CERTIFICATE OF NATURALIZATIONUNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE NATURALIZATION ACT OF NEW SOUTH WALES, 39 VICTORIA, No. 19.Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of an Act of the Governor and Legislature of New South Wales, passed in the thirty-ninth year of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, intituled “An Act to amend the law relating to Aliens,” application to be naturalized has been made by Peter Cooka native of Germany aged 53 years, who is a ???. and arrived in the Colony of New South Wales by the Ship ??? the year 1853 and who has resided in the said Colony for 25 years, and intends to continue to reside therein: AND WHEREAS the said Peter Cookhas duly taken the Oath of Allegiance prescribed by the said Act: Now, therefore, I, the Governor of New South Wales, do, with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, herebyGRANT unto the said Peter Cook all the rights and capacities within the said Colony of New South Wales, of a natural born British subjectGIVEN under my Hand and Seal, at Government House, Sydney, in New South Wales aforesaid, this twenty fourth day of August One thousand eight hundred and were twenty eight.S Hercules Robinson (LS)By His Excellency’s Command,&amp;amp; truchil fitzPatrick.ENTERED on Record; this twenty seventh day of August Eight one thousand eight hundred and seventy eightFor the Colonial Secretary and Registrar of Records." }, { "title": "Michael Laverty and Sarah Jane Mccormick Immigration to Australia on the St Hilda 30th January 1865", "url": "/michael-sarah-laverty-st-hilda-immigration/", "categories": "Laverty Family History", "tags": "Michael Laverty, Sarah Jane McCormick", "date": "1865-01-30 13:39:36 +1004", "snippet": "List of Immigrants per ship : St HildaArrived on the thirtieth day of January 1865 Laverty Michael 30 Sarah 28 Dennis 5 Catherine 3 SarahThe ship “Saint Hilda” landed at Port Jackson on 4.2.1865.Sources : http://freepages.rootsweb.com/~jray/genealogy/dornan/index.htm https://indexes.records.nsw.gov.au/ebook/list.aspx?Page=NRS5316/4_4798/St%20Hilda_30%20Jan%201865/4_479800172.jpg&amp;amp;No=2" }, { "title": "The Cooks of Stuarts Point", "url": "/the-cooks-of-stuarts-point/", "categories": "Laverty Family History", "tags": "Johann Peter Koch", "date": "1853-05-03 00:01:44 +1004", "snippet": "THE COOKS of STUART’S POINTThis history begins in 1853 on May 3rd when Peter Koch (Cook) arrived in Australia on the ship “Droden” from Germany with his wife Anna Catherine (Schroder). He was 25 years old and he and Anna brought with them a baby son Franz (Frank) who was born on 20 Th September 1852 in Wallstadt, Germany. Both of Peter’s parents, George and Elizabeth were deceased as was Anna’s father Jaco but her mother, Catharina was still aliveThe date of the Cook’s arrival at Stuart’s Point is not yet precisely known They would have traveled up the coast by sailing vessel or steamer either to the Macleay or to Port Macquarie and thence onto the Macleay. An application to establish a Public School at Yarr happini in 1880 bears the signature of Peter Cook as being on a committee of seven residents seeking education for their children. At that time Peter and Anna had 12 children but only the last five were young enough to attend school. In March of 1883 the school opened with 21 students enrolled. The first teacher was James Harvey who was 21 and who had no formal training as a teacher but would have spent some weeks in a large school learning the systemIn 1883 the Kirkwood brothers opened a sawmill at Stuart’s Point and a village soon started to grow around the mill Stuart’s Point got it’s own Public School in 1899 and this y t would have seen many of the descendants of Peter and Anna attending. The first teacher, Henry Peck from Wagga Wagga was not impressed with conditions at the Point.“I have an inferior residence one and a quarter miles from school. That distance I have to trudge knee-deep in sand in all weathers I am 26 miles from store, church, doctor etc. and no steamer or coach to reach Kempsey Sometimes my family are without beef for a fortnight, and when supplied it is hardly fit for human consumption Further it is not con venient to keep a borse as there is no grass within miles of the Point. This is the home of Death Adders snakes and sandflies, also the dingo, but few people”This gives a little insight to conditions at Stuart’s Point in the 19th century. Although another sawmill opened in 1886, the work was intermittent and the families were poor, Peter is known to have been a farmer, lay Methodist Minister and a Vine Dresser. It is not known if he worked at the mill He was best known as caretaker of the North Coast Co’s shed and wharf at Stuart’s Point He was naturalized on 27/Aug/1878 Anna was a midwife at Stuart’s PointPeter died in 1909 and his death is recorded in an article from a local newspaper at the time which states he was a very old colo nist It continues “Peter Cook who died at his residence at Stuart’s Point on Friday night last week.
